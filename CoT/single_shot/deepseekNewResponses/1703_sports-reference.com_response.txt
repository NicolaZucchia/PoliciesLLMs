```
**Other: Neutral -** The policy mentions that users should review external sites' privacy policies, which can be inconvenient but doesn't explicitly state it's risky or user-friendly. It adds complexity without providing central control.

**Policy Change: Positive -** The privacy statement provides clear information on how changes will be communicated to visitors, ensuring transparency. By giving 60 days' notice and updating the text with specific sections highlighted, SRL demonstrates responsible practices, making it user-friendly rather than risky.

**First Party Collection/Use: Neutral -** SRL collects first-party data for providing services and marketing. While they offer opt-out options and control over information, the policy lacks explicit transparency about how this data is used beyond necessary functions, making it neutral with some user control but insufficient clarity on usage purposes.

**Data Retention: Negative -** The policy does not address how long personal data is retained, which is crucial for assessing data security practices. Without information on retention periods or policies, it's hard to evaluate positively, leading to a negative sentiment regarding data handling.

**International and Specific Audiences: Neutral -** The policy does not mention anything about handling data for international audiences or specific user groups, so it doesn't provide information that would indicate either friendliness or riskiness regarding these categories.

**Third Party Sharing/Collection: Negative -** The policy acknowledges that SRL isn't responsible for third parties' privacy practices but doesn't provide clear control or consent mechanisms, creating potential risks for users.

**User Choice/Control: Positive -** The section on "Opt-Out Right" provides visitors with the ability to remove their personally identifiable information from retention and use by contacting SRL. This offers control over personal data, which is empowering for users.

**User Access, Edit and Deletion: Neutral -** The policy allows users to remove their data but lacks specific guidance or tools for optimal access methods, which could pose risks for less experienced users.

**Data Security: Neutral -** The Privacy Statement discusses SRL's implementation of security measures such as a secure server and confidential contracts but acknowledges the limitations of internet communication for data transmission. This balanced approach suggests cautious yet protective practices towards user data, hence Neutral sentiment.

**Do Not Track: Negative -** The policy does not address "Do Not Track," implying that users have limited control over third-party data collection practices, making it user-risky.
