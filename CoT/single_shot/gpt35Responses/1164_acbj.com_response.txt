First Party Collection/Use: Negative - The privacy policy indicates that the service collects personally identifiable information with the user's knowledge and consent, including details such as name, contact information, payment information, and device specifications. The service also reserves the right to use, transfer, sell, and share this information for various purposes, including marketing and business needs. This practice may be considered user-risky as it involves extensive collection and potential sharing of personal data without clear limitations on how it will be used.
Data Retention: Neutral - The privacy policy does not explicitly mention a specific data retention period or practice, which could be seen as neutral. While the policy discusses the collection and use of data, it does not provide detailed information on how long the data is retained, leading to a neutral sentiment as the retention aspect is not clearly defined.

Data Security: Neutral - The privacy policy discusses data security measures and acknowledges the limitations of ensuring complete security due to the nature of data transmission and electronic systems.

Do Not Track: Negative - The privacy policy states that the service does not currently support any browser-based Do Not Track (DNT) settings or participate in any DNT frameworks.
