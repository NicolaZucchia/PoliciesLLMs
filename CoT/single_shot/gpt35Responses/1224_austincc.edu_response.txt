Other: Neutral - The "Other" category in the privacy policy covers various aspects such as security measures, accuracy of personal information, offsite links, and providing a contact point for questions. These sections do not inherently suggest either user-friendly or user-risky practices, hence the sentiment classification for this category is Neutral.
Policy Change: Neutral - The privacy policy does not explicitly mention a dedicated section discussing policy changes. However, the absence of such a section does not necessarily indicate a negative or risky practice. Therefore, the sentiment for this category is classified as Neutral.
First Party Collection/Use: Neutral - The privacy policy outlines the collection of information such as internet address, web pages requested, date and time, and type of web browser automatically from all users accessing the ACC website. This information is used for creating summary statistics and assessing user interests without revealing personally identifiable information. While the policy states that personally identifiable information is not retained unless voluntarily provided by the user, the use of cookies and web beacons for tracking user activities may raise some privacy concerns. Overall, the practice of first-party collection and use is neutral as it provides transparency about data collection and usage but also involves tracking technologies that some users may find intrusive.
Data Retention: Neutral - The privacy policy does not explicitly mention a specific data retention period or policy. While it states that personally identifiable information is not retained unless provided voluntarily by the user, it does not provide details on how long such information may be stored or retained. This lack of specific information makes the data retention practice neutral as it does not clearly indicate whether data is retained for an appropriate period or not.
International and Specific Audiences: Neutral - The privacy policy does not specifically address international audiences or specific user groups in detail. While the policy mentions that the website contains links to external websites and that the college is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those external links, it does not provide specific information regarding how international users or specific audiences are treated differently in terms of privacy protection. Therefore, the sentiment for this category is neutral as the policy does not exhibit any user-friendly or user-risky practices towards international or specific audiences.
Third Party Sharing/Collection: Neutral - The privacy policy discusses the collection of information through cookies and pixel tags to track user behavior and deliver targeted advertisements. It states that information collected from cookies will not be used to create user profiles and will only be used in aggregate form. Additionally, it mentions that tracking pixels are used for retargeting advertising through third-party vendors, but no personally identifiable information is collected through these services. Overall, the policy appears to have a neutral stance on third-party sharing and collection practices, providing some reassurance about the handling of user data in these contexts.
User Choice/Control: Neutral - The privacy policy provides users with some level of control over their personal information, such as the option to exclude their information from the student directory and the ability to contact the Help Center with privacy concerns. However, the policy does not explicitly mention comprehensive user control mechanisms like opt-in/opt-out choices for data collection or sharing. Therefore, the sentiment is classified as neutral as the policy offers limited user choice/control options.
User Access, Edit and Deletion: Neutral - The privacy policy does not explicitly mention user access, edit, or deletion rights. While the policy states that users can contact the Help Center for questions or concerns about their personal information, it does not provide specific details on how users can access, edit, or delete their personal data. This lack of clarity results in a neutral sentiment as the policy does not clearly indicate whether user rights in this category are adequately addressed.
Data Security: Positive - The privacy policy clearly states that Austin Community College (ACC) has deployed extensive security measures to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under their control. This demonstrates a proactive approach towards safeguarding personal and confidential information, indicating a positive sentiment towards data security practices.
"Do Not Track": Neutral - The privacy policy does not explicitly mention support for "Do Not Track" requests. While the policy outlines the collection of information through cookies and web beacons, it does not address honoring "Do Not Track" signals from browsers. This lack of specific mention can be considered neutral as it neither indicates active disregard nor explicit support for "Do Not Track" requests.
