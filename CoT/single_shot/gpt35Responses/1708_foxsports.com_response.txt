Other: Neutral - The privacy policy discusses various aspects related to user data collection, usage, and disclosure, including information not specifically categorized in other sections. The handling of "Other" aspects appears to be neutral as it covers a wide range of miscellaneous topics without explicitly indicating user-friendly or user-risky practices.
Policy Change: Neutral - The privacy policy clearly states that FSD may modify the policy, and any changes will become effective when the revised policy is posted on the FSD Services. This practice is neutral as it informs users about potential changes but does not explicitly indicate whether the changes will benefit or harm users.
First Party Collection/Use: Neutral - The privacy policy outlines the collection and use of various types of information from users, including registration information, public information and posts, social media information, site activity information, cookies, and information from other sources. While the policy provides detailed information about the types of data collected and how it is used, it also mentions that users can manage their cookie settings and opt-out of certain practices. Overall, the discussion on first-party collection and use appears to be neutral as it provides transparency but also involves various data collection practices that users may need to be cautious about.
Data Retention: Neutral - The privacy policy states that the company will retain user information for the period necessary to fulfill the outlined purposes unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law. It also mentions that even after an account is canceled, some information may still be viewable in certain circumstances. While the policy provides transparency about data retention practices, the mention of potential retention of information even after account cancellation may raise some concerns for users, leading to a neutral sentiment classification.
International and Specific Audiences: Neutral - The privacy policy mentions that the FSD Services are hosted in and managed from the United States, and users outside the U.S. consent to their information being processed in the U.S. It also advises users to read the policy carefully due to potential differences in data protection laws. This information is neutral as it simply informs users of the data processing location and advises them to review the policy accordingly.
Third Party Sharing/Collection: Negative - The privacy policy discusses third-party sharing and collection extensively, indicating a user-risky practice. The policy mentions that third parties supporting the FSD Services may collect information using tracking technologies, and FSD does not control these third-party technologies. Additionally, the policy states that FSD may share user information with various entities, including unaffiliated companies, social media platforms, and business partners. This extensive sharing of user data with third parties without full control over their practices raises privacy concerns and indicates a negative sentiment towards user privacy protection.
User Choice/Control: Neutral - The privacy policy provides mechanisms for users to access, review, correct, update, suppress, or limit the use of their personal information. It also allows users to opt-out of sharing personal information for direct marketing purposes. However, the policy mentions that FSD may use or disclose information without providing notice or choice in certain situations. Overall, the user choice/control practices are neutral as they offer some control options but also include exceptions where user consent may not be required.
User Access, Edit and Deletion: Positive - The privacy policy provides clear instructions on how users can access, review, correct, update, suppress, or limit the use of their personal information. It also allows users to request not to share their information with affiliates or third parties for direct marketing purposes. The policy demonstrates a user-friendly practice by offering mechanisms for users to control their data and providing contact information for inquiries.
Data Security: Positive - The privacy policy states that Fox Sports Digital (FSD) uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel, and physical measures to safeguard information against loss, theft, and unauthorized use. This indicates a proactive approach to data security, which is a positive practice for users.
Do Not Track: Neutral - The privacy policy states, "Do Not Track Signals. At this time we do not respond to browser Do Not Track' signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted." This practice is neutral as it indicates that the company does not currently respond to "Do Not Track" signals but acknowledges the ongoing discussions and developments in this area.
