These sections provide necessary information and options for users to manage their data and privacy concerns. Overall, the content in this category appears to be informative and standard for privacy policies, neither overly positive nor negative, hence classified as neutral.
Policy Change: Neutral - The privacy policy states that if there are changes to the policy, they will be posted on the page, and the changes will apply to information collected after the date of the change. This practice of informing users about policy changes is neutral as it provides transparency and allows users to be aware of any modifications that may affect their data privacy.
First Party Collection/Use: Neutral - The privacy policy outlines the information collected from users when they interact with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette website. While the policy clearly states what information is collected and how it may be used, it also highlights that certain information provided by users may be published on the site at the discretion of the Post-Gazette. This practice can be seen as neutral as it provides transparency about data collection and usage but also raises some concerns about user control over their submitted content.
Data Retention: Neutral - The privacy policy does not explicitly mention a specific data retention period or policy. While it states that collected information may be used for various purposes, including publishing comments and analyzing user activities, it does not provide clear details on how long the data is retained. This lack of specific information leads to a neutral sentiment as it does not clearly indicate whether the data retention practices are user-friendly or user-risky.
International and Specific Audiences: Neutral - The privacy policy discusses the collection of information from users accessing the site from different countries or entities such as corporations or educational institutions. While the policy outlines how information may be collected and used from these specific audiences, it does not explicitly indicate whether the practices are particularly user-friendly or risky for international or specific audiences. Therefore, the sentiment for this category is considered neutral.

User Choice/Control: Neutral - The privacy policy provides users with some level of control over their information by allowing them to update their personal information and providing options to manage cookies. However, the policy also states that certain information may be shared with third parties for various purposes, which could limit users' control over their data. Overall, the user choice/control aspect is considered neutral as it offers some control but also involves sharing information with third parties.
User Access, Edit and Deletion: Neutral - The privacy policy provides information on how users can correct or update their personally identifiable information through the My Profile Page or by contacting the provided email or phone number. While the policy outlines the process for users to access and update their information, it does not explicitly mention deletion of user data, which could be seen as a limitation. Overall, the practice is neutral as it allows users some control over their information but could be more comprehensive in addressing deletion requests.
Data Security: Neutral - The privacy policy states that the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette follows generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use personal information. However, it also acknowledges that no commercial method of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage is known to be 100% secure. This acknowledgment of the limitations of security measures indicates a realistic approach to data security, resulting in a neutral sentiment classification.
"Do Not Track": Neutral - The privacy policy does not explicitly mention support for "Do Not Track" requests, which allows users to opt-out of tracking their online activities. This omission indicates a neutral stance as the policy neither actively supports nor opposes user control over tracking.
