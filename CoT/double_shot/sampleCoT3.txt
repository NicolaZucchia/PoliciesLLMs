Let's think step by step.

In the privacy policy:
"{policy_text}"

you have identified with "Yes" the present categories:
"{policy_categories}"

For only the present category, locate where it is discussed in the policy and evaluate the sentiment based on the following steps:
- Step 1: Identify the relevant section of the text for this category.
- Step 2: Analyze whether the text suggests a user-friendly or user-risky practice.
- Step 3: Conclude with a sentiment classification for this category (e.g., Positive, Neutral, Negative) and explain why.

In the answer, provide only the final sentiment analysis for each category in the following format:  
Category Name: Sentiment (e.g. Positive, Neutral, Negative) - [Brief Explanation]

Now, analyze the categories and provide your reasoning for each.
