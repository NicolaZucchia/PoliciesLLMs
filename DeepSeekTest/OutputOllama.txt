First, I recognize that the given equation is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 6 \).

To solve this equation, I'll use the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Substituting the known values into the formula:
\[ x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(1)(6)}}{2(1)} \]
\[ x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2} \]

This gives two solutions:
\[ x = \frac{-5 + 1}{2} = -2 \]
\[ x = \frac{-5 - 1}{2} = -3 \]

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are \( x = -2 \) and \( x = -3 \).

To solve the quadratic equation:

\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \]

we can use the **quadratic formula**:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 6 \).

**Step 1:** Identify the coefficients.

\[ a = 1, \quad b = 5, \quad c = 6 \]

**Step 2:** Plug the values into the quadratic formula.

\[
x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{5^2 - 4(1)(6)}}{2(1)}
\]

**Step 3:** Simplify inside the square root.

\[
x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 24}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{-5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2}
\]

**Step 4:** Calculate the square root and find both solutions.

\[
x = \frac{-5 + 1}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2
\]
\[
x = \frac{-5 - 1}{2} = \frac{-6}{2} = -3
\]

**Final Solutions:**

\[
\boxed{x = -2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -3}
\]
