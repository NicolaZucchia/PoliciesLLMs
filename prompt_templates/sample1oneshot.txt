B. Tracking Technology Choices.â¢ Cookies and Pixels. Most browsers accept cookies by default. If you would prefer not to receive cookies, you can alter the configuration of your browser to refuse or delete cookies. If you use multiple browsers on your device, you will need to instruct each browser separately. Your ability to limit cookies is subject to your browser settings and limitations. If you choose to have your browser refuse cookies, some areas of our Sites may not function properly.

â¢ Do Not Track. Your browser may allow you to set a Do Not Track (DNT) signal indicating that you do not wish your online activity to be tracked. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what site and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, unless and until the law is interpreted to require us to do so, our Sites' system does not support, monitor, or act on DNT signal headers that we may receive. However, the choices that we provide you concerning collection and use of your information will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy. For more information on Do Not Track, visit https://www.allaboutdnt.com.

â¢ App Technologies. You can stop all collection of information via an App by uninstalling the App. You can also reset your device Ad Id at any time through your device settings, which is designed to allow you to limit the use of information collected about you.

For Google Analytics, you can find their opt-out by visiting: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB and downloading the Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on, or visiting Google Analytics for Display Advertising of the Google Display Network at https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/.

Where we work with other companies to engage in behavioral advertising, these companies are often members of the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) and/or the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). These programs offer centralized locations where users can make choices about the use of their information for behavioral advertising. To learn more about the DAA's Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising and your opt-out options for their members, please visit (i) for website opt-out, https://www.aboutads.info/choices; and (ii) for mobile app opt-out, https://www.aboutads.info/appchoices.

You may also limit our use of information collected from or about your mobile device for purposes of serving targeted ads to you by going to your device settings and selecting Limit Ad Tracking (for iOS devices) or Opt out of Interest-Based Ads (for Android devices).

Please note that any opt-outs only apply to the specific browser or device from which you opt-out. Further, opting-out through the DAA or NAI only means that the selected members should no longer deliver certain behavioral advertising to you, and does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). We are not responsible for the effectiveness of, or compliance with, any entity's opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their practices or programs.

Data Subjects Located in the EU: For European specific requests, you can use any of the methods above or as further specified in the What Should I Know as a Data Subject in Europe? section below.

Back to the top 13. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW AS A DATA SUBJECT IN EUROPE?A. Budge Studios is a Data Controller.Data protection laws in Europe make a distinction between organizations that process personal data for their own purposes (known as controllers) and organizations that process personal data on behalf of other organizations (known as processors). Budge Studios acts as a controller with respect to personal data collected as you interact with our apps, websites, emails, and advertisements.

B. Budge Studios has a Lawful Basis for Processing.Data protection laws in Europe require a lawful basis for processing personal data. Our lawful bases include where: (a) you have given consent to the processing for one or more specific purposes, either to us or to our service providers or partners; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (d) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, and your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms do not override those interests. We retain personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected, or for other legitimate purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements.

C. Your European Privacy Rights.If you are a data subject in Europe, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase any personal data we have collected about you. You also have the right to data portability and the right to restrict or object to our processing of personal data we have collected about you. In addition, you have the right to ask us not to process your personal data (or provide it to third parties to process) for marketing purposes or purposes materially different than for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may withdraw your consent at any time for any data processing we do based on consent you have provided to us.

You may exercise your rights by submitting a written request to us at the address set out in the How Do I Contact Budge Studios? section above. We will respond to your request within 30 days. We may request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and process your request. Applicable law may require or permit us to decline your request. If we decline your request, we will tell you why, subject to legal restrictions.

D. Children in Europe.Where the basis for our processing of personal data from children under 16 in Europe is consent, we will make appropriate efforts to verify that consent is given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility over those children, and, if we learn or have reason to suspect that we have collected personal data from those children without parental consent, we will promptly delete it. If you are a child under 16 in Europe, please speak with your parent or guardian about this Privacy Policy so you can better understand how we use your personal data.

E. Complaints.If you have a complaint about our use of your personal data or response to your requests regarding your personal data, you may submit a complaint to the data protection regulator in your jurisdiction. We would, however, appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns before you approach a data protection regulator, and would welcome you directing an inquiry first to us.

In addition to the contact information above, please contact our Data Protection Officer at dpo@budgestudios.comBack to the top 14. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW AS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT? These additional disclosures for California residents apply only to individuals who reside in California. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) provides additional rights, and requires businesses collecting or disclosing personal information to provide notices and means to exercise those rights.

A. Notice of Collection.In the past 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information listed in the CCPA: â¢ Identifiers, and an ID or number. â¢ Commercial information, including purchases and engagement with the Platforms. â¢ Internet activity, including your interactions with our Platforms. â¢ Employment and education data that you provide when you apply for a job with us.

For more information on information we collect, including the sources we receive information from, review the What Information does Budge Studios Collect? section. We collect and use these categories of personal information for the business purposes described in the How Does Budge Studios Use the Information Collected? section, including to provide and manage our Platforms.

Budge Studios does not sell information as the term sell is traditionally understood. To the extent sale under the CCPA is interpreted to include advertising technology activities such as those disclosed in the Analytics and Advertising section as a sale, we will comply with applicable law as to such activity. We use and partner with different types of entities to assist with our daily operations and manage our Platforms. Please review the How Does Budge Studios Share or Disclose Information? section for more detail about the parties we have shared information with.

B. Right to Know and Delete.If you are a California resident, you have the right to delete the personal information we have collected from you and the right to know certain information about our data practices in the preceding 12 months. In particular, you have the right to request the following from us: â¢ The categories of personal information we have collected about you; â¢ The categories of sources from which the personal information was collected; â¢ The categories of personal information about you we disclosed for a business purpose or sold; â¢ The categories of third parties to whom the personal information was disclosed for a business purpose or sold; â¢ The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling the personal information; and â¢ The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.

To exercise any of these rights, please submit a request through our online form available at https://forms.gle/VQbnkDKTmbUVWAQF8, or email us at privacy@budgestudios.ca. In the request, please specify which right you are seeking to exercise and the scope of the request. We will confirm receipt of your request within 10 days. We may require a copy of your national ID (passport or Driving License) to help us verify your identity and process your request.

C. Authorized Agent.You can designate an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf. However, we will require written proof of the agent's permission to do so and verify your identity directly.

D. Right to Non-Discrimination.You have the right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for the exercise of any of your rights.

E. Children.As described above, under How Does Budge Studios Handle Children's Information?, we take steps to avoid collecting information that would individually identify a child. We do not knowingly sell personal information of minors under 16 years old, as that term is defined under the CCPA.

F. Shine the Light.California's Shine the Light law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties' and affiliates' own direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business should either provide California customers certain information upon request or permit California customers to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing.

If you are a California resident and wish to obtain information about our compliance with this law, please contact us as set out in the How Do I Contact Budge Studios? section above. Requests must include California Privacy Rights Request in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that Budge Studios is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided email address or mail address.

15. WHAT SHOULD I KNOW AS A NEVADA RESIDENT? Nevada consumers may submit requests directing a business not to sell certain kinds of personal information that the business has collected or will collect about the consumer. A sale under Nevada law is the exchange of personal information for monetary consideration by the business to a third party for the third party to license or sell the personal information to other third parties.

Children Under the Age of 13 Years MovieStarPlanet is a movie themed online game and social network aimed at children aged between 8 and 15 years. The only personal information we collect from children, under 13, is their email address (to reset their password) and their parents' email address to notify their parents that they have joined the site. This email also advises parents that there is the possibility to use chat rooms and forums chat with their friends. We employ trained moderators and "approved lists" that are designed to screen the participation of users under 13 and prevent their disclosure of personally identifiable information in interactive areas of the Website, such as chat rooms. Sanctions may be applied to any user that attempts to share or collect personal information.

In relation to collecting the information stated above, parents or legal guardians may at any time change the access to or completely opt-out of these socially interactive features. Any such personally identifiable information that is collected, and the required access to change or opt-out, are specified in the direct notice mails sent to the individual Parent or legal guardian. The only personal information we collect from children under 13 is their email address (to reset their password) and their parents' email address to notify their parents that they have joined the site.

IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AND YOU BELIEVE YOUR CHILD UNDER THE AGE OF 13 HAS PROVIDED PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO MOVIESTARPLANET WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT, PLEASE CONTACT US AT us@moviestarplanet.zendesk.com SO THAT WE MAY TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION by deleting their PII immediately.

How We Use Your Personally Identifiable Information We only use the personally identifiable information you provide us to operate, maintain, customize and enhance the features we provide you on the Website. We also use the information to communicate with you for administrative purposes, such as to help you reset your password. Where you have signed up to make purchases of certain products or services offered on the Website using a cell phone, we use the personally identifiable information you provide in order to fulfill those purchases.

A child's participation in or their ability to access an activity will not be conditioned on them providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for that activity.

Personally Identifiable Information We are not in the business of selling personally identifiable information; however, we may disclose information to third parties in the following circumstances: We may disclose information to others who provide services to us in order to operate, maintain and enhance the features of the Website, such as website hosting services providers. Where such service providers receive personally identifiable information in order to furnish services to us, they must agree to privacy terms ostensibly the same as the terms in MovieStarPlanet's Privacy Policy. Furthermore, the use of personally identifiable information is limited to the use needed in order to furnish those services to us. We may disclose information to others if we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, to respond to court orders, judicial or regulatory subpoenas and information requests or to otherwise comply with law enforcement. We may disclose information to others if we believe such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to take precautions against liability or to enforce our rights; to protect us and users from unlawful or abusive activity; to investigate and defend ourselves against claims or allegations from third parties; to protect the security or integrity of the Website; or to protect the rights, property or personal safety of MovieStarPlanet, our users or third parties.

Users may also choose to disclose personally identifiable information in many interactive areas of the Website if over 13 years of age (See Children Under the Age of 13 years, above). These areas include user's public profile page, chat rooms and the movies users create. Many of these features also connect directly to other third-party services such as YouTube. Disclosing personally identifiable information in this way is against the Rules and users should not do it. The Community Sift Automated Content Management System alerts trained Moderators to possible infringements of this rule and sanctions will be applied to users who attempt to circumvent the filters. Once personally identifiable information is made available, it may be collected and used by any person who has access to this content without restriction. If personal information has been disclosed on YouTube, it may be accessed and used by anybody on the Internet. Please note, that once individuals have disclosed such information in this way, it may be impossible to delete it.

Links The website may contain links to other websites not controlled by MovieStarPlanet. We make no representations or warranties concerning such websites. When individuals use external websites, their use is governed by that site's privacy policies and not by MovieStarPlanet's Privacy Policy. Users should review the privacy policies of each website carefully before providing any information.

Legal Notice In certain situations, MovieStarPlanet may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.

We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.

However, in the event all or a portion of the business of MovieStarPlanet is sold, either through a sale of assets, a sale of stock, a merger or otherwise, we reserve the right to transfer or assign all or a portion of the information that we have collected in connection with such sale you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

Data Security We use physical, administrative and technical features designed to increase the security and integrity of our systems used to store personally identifiable information. We cannot, however, guarantee the security of any information transmitted to MovieStarPlanet, nor can we guarantee that any such information may not be accessed, altered or destroyed by a breach, circumvention, failure or interruption of any of our physical, technical or administrative safeguards.
