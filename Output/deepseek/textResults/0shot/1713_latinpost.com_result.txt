Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if Latin Post's privacy policy affirms that they collect personal data. Let me read through the provided privacy policy carefully.

Starting from the top, it mentions that the policy is for the terms of using their site and outlines what happens when you use it. The first section talks about information collected, but I'm looking specifically at whether they collect personal data.

Looking further down, section 3 says something about User ID. It states that we are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of our User ID and that if someone else uses it without permission, we can deny access. So this implies that Latin Post does collect a User ID, which is a form of personal data because it's tied to an individual.

Additionally, section 5 talks about Data Security, which is important but doesn't directly answer the question on its own. However, since they mention collection and usage in other sections, it seems like they do handle personal information beyond just logging in.

So putting it all together, Latin Post does collect User IDs as part of their services, which are forms of personal data.
