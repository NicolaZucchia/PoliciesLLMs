Okay, I need to analyze the provided privacy policy text and determine whether each of the expected elements is "true" or "false." Let me go through each category one by one.

First Party Collection/Use: The policy mentions that they collect data through their website and online services. They use this data for marketing purposes, which involves their own operations (first-party). So this should be true.

Data Retention: I don't see any mention of how long they keep the collected data or if it's ever deleted. This information is missing, so it's false.

International and Specific Audiences: The policy does talk about California privacy rights, which indicates a focus on specific audiences in that region. So this should be true.

Third Party Sharing/Collection: They do mention sharing personal information with third-party advertising partners. Therefore, this is true.

User Choice/Control: There's no indication that users have the ability to control or opt out of data collection beyond the California section. So this is false.

User Access, Edit and Deletion: Similarly, they don't provide any mechanisms for users to access, edit, or delete their personal information. This is also false.

Do Not Track: The policy doesn't mention anything about a do not track mechanism, so it's false.

Data Security: They mention cookies and some security measures, but the text isn't detailed enough on actual security practices beyond that. So this remains false.

Putting it all together, I'll mark each point based on whether the information is present or can be inferred from the policy.
