Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to answer this query about whether certain aspects of NOTMC's privacy policy are affected by a policy change. The user provided a detailed privacy policy document, which is quite long. They want me to evaluate specific points related to data collection, retention, third-party sharing, user choice, etc.

First, I need to go through each expected output line and see if they're true or false based on the provided policy.

1. **Data: Answer**
   - The first point mentions "Data." The policy refers to Personal Information and Data Collection, so this should be true.
   
2. **Other: true**
   - This is a placeholder for other aspects not specified here; probably referring to general compliance with laws or other policies, which I assume is true since it's a standard part.

3. **Policy Change: true**
   - The policy states that any change will be effective 60 days after notification and includes a formal process. So yes, there has been a policy change.

4. **First Party Collection/Use: true**
   - The policy talks about using data for marketing, website improvement, etc., which are all first-party uses. That's correct.

5. **Data Retention: false**
   - Looking at the retention section, it says cookies have an expiration period but doesn't specify a set time frame beyond that (e.g., 13 months). So if there’s no clear retention policy, this should be false.

6. **International and Specific Audiences: true**
   - The policy mentions California privacy rights, international reach, etc., so this applies.

7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection: true**
   - The policy talks about sharing data with third-party advertising partners, so yes.

8. **User Choice/Control: true**
   - Users can manage cookies and opt-out of certain tracking via settings, which is user control.

9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion: true**
   - There's no mention of users being able to access, edit, or delete their data directly; this might depend on other factors like account security. So probably false.

10. **Data Security: true**
    - The policy mentions measures against data loss, access, disclosure, etc., so it’s secure.

11. **Do Not Track: false**
    - The policy uses cookies and tracking technologies but doesn’t explicitly enforce Do Not Track signals, so this is false.

Putting it all together, the expected outputs should be as per each point's evaluation.

The analysis evaluates whether specific aspects of NOTMC's privacy policy are affected by a policy change. Based on the provided policy document, the following conclusions are drawn:

- **Data: Answer**: The policy refers to Personal Information and Data Collection, so this is true.
- **Other**: A placeholder for other unspecified policies or practices; assuming it refers to general compliance with laws or other policies, which is true since it's a standard part of such documents.
- **Policy Change**: The document mentions that any change will be effective 60 days after notification and outlines a formal process, so this is true.
- **First Party Collection/Use**: The policy discusses the use of data for marketing and website improvement, which are first-party uses; hence, this is true.
- **Data Retention**: The policy does not specify a clear retention period beyond cookies' expiration (e.g., 13 months), so there's no clear retention policy here; thus, this is false.
- **International and Specific Audiences**: The document mentions California privacy rights, international reach, etc., making this true.
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy refers to sharing data with third-party advertising partners, so this is true.
- **User Choice/Control**: Users can manage cookies and opt-out of certain tracking via settings; hence, this is true.
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: There's no mention of users being able to access, edit, or delete their data directly; this might depend on other factors like account security. Thus, it’s likely false.
- **Data Security**: The policy mentions measures against data loss, access, disclosure, etc., so this is true.
- **Do Not Track**: The policy uses cookies and tracking technologies but does not explicitly enforce Do Not Track signals, making this false.

The final evaluation of the expected outputs is as follows:

```
Data: true
Other: true
Policy Change: true
First Party Collection/Use: true
Data Retention: false
International and Specific Audiences: true
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
User Choice/Control: true
User Access, Edit and Deletion: false
Data Security: true
Do Not Track: false
```
