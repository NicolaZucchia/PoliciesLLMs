Alright, let's try to tackle this problem. I have a text that outlines the privacy policy of a company called NOTMC. The task is to determine if certain aspects of their policies are affected by a policy change. Specifically, I need to look at eight categories: Data Collection, First Party Collection/Use, Data Retention, International and Specific Audiences, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Choice/Control, User Access, Edit, and Deletion (UAAED), Data Security, and Do Not Track.

First, I'll read through the provided text carefully to identify key points about each category. 

1. **Data Collection**: The text mentions that NOTMC collects information through cookies and other technologies used for online services. They also collect personal data related to user interactions, purchases, and browsing behavior.

2. **First Party Collection/Use**: They use this data for improving the online experience, tracking online purchases, and sending promotional content. This is clearly first-party data since it's directly from their users.

3. **Data Retention**: The text states that they don't track user information beyond what's necessary for their services. There's no mention of retaining data longer than needed or specific retention policies except for cookies, which typically have a cookie duration (like 2 years in one instance mentioned). So, data is retained only temporarily.

4. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy doesn't cater to users outside the US, as it targets New Orleans specifically. There's no mention of handling international audiences or translating into other languages for consistency with data privacy laws like GDPR.

5. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: They do share user data with third-party advertising partners using cookies and clear GIFs, which falls under this category.

6. **User Choice/Control**: The text doesn't provide any information on how users can control or edit their personal information beyond contacting the company to request a list of shared data or deleting specific information about minors. This suggests that user control is limited.

7. **User Access, Edit and Deletion (UAAED)**: Similarly, there's no indication that users have access to their personal information, ability to edit it, or options to delete it through the platform beyond contacting the company in specific circumstances.

8. **Data Security**: The policy mentions measures like cookies for security, but it also acknowledges potential vulnerabilities and recommends users take additional security measures, such as antivirus software.

9. **Do Not Track**: It's clear that NOTMC doesn't implement do-not-track mechanisms because they rely on cookies and other tracking technologies to provide services.

Now, I need to evaluate each category based on whether there has been a policy change or if the data is collected/used in certain ways. 

- **Data Collection**: They continue to collect personal information for their services.
- **First Party Use**: They keep using first-party data as before.
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: Yes, they're still sharing with third parties.
- **User Choice/Control and UAAED**: These are areas where user control is limited based on the text.
- **Data Security**: They have measures but also mention vulnerabilities, so it's not fully secure yet.
- **Do Not Track**: They don't have a do-not-track policy.

Putting this together, I think there hasn't been a significant change in data collection or use. However, they've maintained their practices regarding third-party sharing and data security while lacking user control options.

The analysis indicates that NOTMC's privacy policies continue to involve the collection of personal information for tracking and marketing purposes without notable changes. Third-party sharing is still active, and while they have measures in place for data security, there are limitations on users' ability to control or edit their information. 

**Answer:**

- **Data Collection**: Yes
- **First Party Use**: Yes
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: Yes
- **User Choice/Control**: No
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion (UAAED)**: No
- **Data Security**: Not yet fully secure
- **Do Not Track**: No
