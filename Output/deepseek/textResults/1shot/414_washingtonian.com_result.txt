Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how this Privacy Policy fits into the different categories mentioned. Let me go through each one step by step.

First Party Collection/Use: The policy clearly states that they collect information through their online services and use it for marketing purposes. So yes, that's true.

Data Retention: It doesn't specify how long their data is kept beyond what is necessary, so I'm not sure if this applies or maybe it's false.

International and Specific Audiences: The policy mentions California privacy rights but doesn't explicitly cover international aspects, so probably true only for the specified regions.

Third Party Sharing/Collection: They do mention that they use cookies to track users across third-party sites, which implies they're sharing data with those partners. So that's true.

User Choice/Control: There's an option to contact them about California privacy rights and also a method to delete data if you're the parent of someone under 13, but it doesn't mention other user controls like opting out of marketing or managing cookies directly on their end. Maybe this is mostly false except for specific cases.

User Access, Edit and Deletion: The policy allows users to contact them with specific requests about their information, so access and editing are possible, but full control isn't provided. So perhaps true as there's some control.

Data Security: They do mention measures to protect data, though not 100% secure, so that's likely true.

Do Not Track: I don't see any DNT signals or tracking pixels mentioned, so this would be false.

Putting it all together, the categories should mark certain aspects as true and others as false based on what's detailed in the policy.

The Privacy Policy aligns with some of the categories outlined but not all. Here is a concise summary:

- **First Party Collection/Use:** True (Information collected and used for marketing)
- **Data Retention:** Not explicitly specified
- **International and Specific Audiences:** Partially true for California, unspecified globally
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection:** True (Cookies track users across third-party sites)
- **User Choice/Control:** Partially true (Specific requests and data deletion option)
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion:** Partially true (Request-based access and deletion)
- **Data Security:** True (Security measures mentioned)
- **Do Not Track:** False

Answer: Data: true; Other: not specified; Policy Change: no mention.
