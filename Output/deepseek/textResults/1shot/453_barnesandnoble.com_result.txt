Okay, so I have this problem where I need to evaluate a given privacy policy and determine the truth value of several statements related to it. The expected output is Data: Answer, Other: true, Policy Change: true, etc., based on whether each statement about the privacy policy is correct or not.

First, let me read through the provided privacy policy carefully to understand its key points. 

The policy mentions that NOTMC collects and uses personal information from users who interact with their online services. They collect data for marketing purposes, including sending promotional emails. They also mention cookies being used to track user behavior on their website. Users have options regarding cookies, like managing or deleting them through their web browsers.

Additionally, the policy states that they do not target children under 13 and do not knowingly collect personal information from such users. It also outlines how users can exercise their California Privacy Rights by requesting a list of shared data within one year. Furthermore, the policy provides contact information for questions about privacy practices.

Now, I need to evaluate each statement:

1. **Data Collection/Use**: The policy states that NOTMC collects personal information for marketing purposes and sends promotional emails. This seems true.
2. **Data Retention**: The policy doesn't specify how long they keep the data or if it's retained indefinitely. It mentions cookies can be managed, but there's no info on retention periods beyond the session. So this might not necessarily be false but also isn't confirmed as true based solely on the given text.
3. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy does mention California-specific privacy rights, indicating they cater to a specific audience in California for data sharing requests. This is likely true.
4. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy talks about using cookies set by their own agents and third-party services through social networking links, implying third parties might receive information. So this seems true.
5. **User Choice/Control**: They allow users to manage cookies, suggesting some control over data sharing with third parties. This is probably true.
6. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy mentions users can contact them to exercise their rights, which implies access but not necessarily editing or deletion options directly from the site. So maybe partially true, but it's unclear if they offer direct editing controls.
7. **Data Security**: They mention using cookies and other technologies for tracking, implying some security measures, though not explicitly detailed. It's a bit ambiguous whether data is secure or fully compliant with standards.

Wait, in my initial analysis, I considered Data Retention as false because the policy doesn't specify retention periods beyond session-based cookies. But perhaps the policy implies it continues to use the information indefinitely since marketing emails are likely ongoing. So maybe Data Retention should be true after all. Also, for User Access, Edit and Deletion, if users can only exercise rights via contact rather than direct access, then those options might not be directly available through the platform.

Also, regarding Do Not Track: The policy doesn't mention any explicit do not track mechanisms or directives, so this would likely be false.

I need to reassess each statement based on these considerations and ensure accuracy in my evaluations.

Based on a thorough evaluation of the provided privacy policy, here is the structured analysis:

1. **Data Collection/Use**: True - NOTMC collects personal information for marketing purposes and sends promotional emails.
2. **Data Retention**: False - The policy does not specify retention periods beyond session-based cookies, so it's unclear if data is retained indefinitely.
3. **International and Specific Audiences**: True - The policy mentions California-specific privacy rights, indicating a focus on a specific audience.
4. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True - The policy implies third parties may receive information through social networking links.
5. **User Choice/Control**: True - Users can manage cookies via their web browsers, suggesting some control over data sharing.
6. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False - The policy allows users to exercise rights by contacting them but does not specify direct access, editing, or deletion options from the platform.
7. **Data Security**: False - The policy mentions using cookies and tracking technologies but lacks explicit details on full security measures.
8. **Do Not Track**: False - The policy does not mention any do not track mechanisms.

Answer: true  
Other: true  
Policy Change: false
