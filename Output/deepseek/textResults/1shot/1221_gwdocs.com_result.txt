Alright, let's try to break this down. I have a problem where I need to evaluate different aspects of NOTMC's privacy policy based on the given expected output. The user has provided a detailed privacy policy and expects me to determine whether each of the specified areas applies to it.

First, I'll read through the entire privacy policy carefully to understand what they collect, how they use it, etc. Then, for each category in the expected output (Data Collection/Usage, Data Retention, International, Third Party Sharing, User Choice, User Access/Edit/Delete, Data Security, Do Not Track), I'll check if that aspect is covered.

Starting with "First Party Collection/Use": The policy mentions cookies and tracking technologies used to improve online experience and manage advertising. So yes, they collect their own data through these methods.

Next, "Data Retention": The policy states NOTMC uses cookies but doesn't specify a lifetime period or retention time beyond browser capabilities. Since it's not explicitly mentioned how long they keep the information, I'll mark this as false unless it's implied otherwise.

"International and Specific Audiences": The policy is written in English, and while there might be international visitors, there's no mention of targeting children under 13 or any specific audience restrictions beyond that. So probably not applicable here.

"Third Party Sharing/Collection": The policy talks about sharing information with advertising partners but doesn't explicitly say they share it with third parties outside of that context. However, since they do use external services for ads, I think this is true.

"User Choice/Control": The policy allows users to manage cookies via browser settings and provides contact info for questions, so yes, there's some control over user choice.

"User Access, Edit and Deletion": There’s no mention of how users can access, edit, or delete their data. The only option is contacting them for deletion if it's a child's account, which isn't detailed here. So this seems false.

"Data Security": They mention using cookies to protect user information but don’t discuss encryption or other security measures in detail beyond that. So maybe not explicitly stated as true.

"Do Not Track": The policy doesn’t reference any DNT mechanisms, so this is false.

Putting it all together, I think the answer should reflect where each aspect applies based on the details provided.

The evaluation of NOTMC's privacy policy based on the expected output categories is as follows:

- **First Party Collection/Use**: true  
  The policy mentions cookies and tracking technologies used for managing online experience and advertising.

- **Data Retention**: false  
  The policy doesn’t specify retention periods but relies on browser capabilities, making it not explicitly defined.

- **International and Specific Audiences**: false  
  No mention of targeting children under 13 or specific audience restrictions beyond general content.

- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: true  
  The policy uses external advertising partners for tracking, implying third-party data collection.

- **User Choice/Control**: true  
  Users can manage cookies via browser settings and provide contact info for deletion queries.

- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: false  
  No details on editing or deleting personal information directly.

- **Data Security**: false  
  Privacy policy doesn't discuss encryption or detailed security measures beyond cookie usage.

- **Do Not Track**: false  
  Policy lacks any DNT mechanisms.

Answer: Data: true, Other: false, Policy Change: false, First Party Collection/Use: true, Data Retention: false, International and Specific Audiences: false, Third Party Sharing/Collection: true, User Choice/Control: true, User Access, Edit and Deletion: false, Data Security: false, Do Not Track: false
