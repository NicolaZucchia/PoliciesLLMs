Okay, so I have to analyze the provided text to determine which parts of the expected output are correct. The user has given me a detailed Privacy Policy from NOTMC and wants me to check each category in the expected output to see if it's "true" or "false." 

Let me start by reading through the entire policy carefully.

First, I notice that the policy talks about collecting personal information, using it for marketing, managing online services, handling cookies, etc. The user expects a list of 14 points (Data, Other, Policy Change, etc.) to be evaluated as true or false based on the content of this Privacy Policy.

Looking at each point in the expected output:

1. **Data Collection**: The policy does mention collecting data like names, addresses, phone numbers for marketing purposes. So Data is true.
2. **Other Practices**: It's not just about data; there are other practices mentioned, so Other is true.
3. **Policy Change**: The policy states that any changes will be effective immediately and communicated to users via email. So Policy Change is true.
4. **First Party Collection/Use**: They collect their own user data for their services (not third parties). First Party is true.
5. **Data Retention**: I don't see anything about how long data is kept, so Data Retention is false.
6. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy mentions California rights but doesn’t specify targeting children or international audiences beyond that. So International is partially mentioned but not explicitly stated as specific. However, since it's a general Privacy Policy without excluding any regions except California, I think International might be true if considering the absence of regional exclusions.
7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy mentions sharing with advertisers and management partners. Third Party is true.
8. **User Choice/Control**: It talks about user ability to opt out or manage cookies but doesn't specify users having full control, so User Choice might be false. However, it does provide contact info for inquiries, which could imply some level of control.
9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy allows users to contact for account management but doesn’t give direct access codes, so maybe User Access is true if considering the option exists through contacting.
10. **Data Security**: They mention security measures but don't explicitly say they are secure or tested, so Data Security might be false.
11. **Do Not Track**: The policy doesn't address a "do not track" mechanism, so it's false.

Wait, I'm getting confused with some points like International and User Choice/Control. For International, since the policy only mentions California rights without excluding other countries, maybe it should be true because it applies to more than one region. But if there were no specific mention of international policies, perhaps it's false. This is a bit tricky.

Similarly, for User Choice/Control: The policy allows users to contact for account management but doesn't give direct access codes or delete options. So maybe it's false because actual user control isn't provided beyond contacting online@notmc.com.

For User Access, the ability to access information exists via contacting, so if that counts as access, then true. But usually, data security and access would be about automated means.

I think I might have some uncertainties here, especially around International and User Choice/Control. Maybe better to mark them as true only if explicitly stated or implied.

Based on the analysis of the provided Privacy Policy, here is the evaluation for each category:

1. **Data Collection**: True
2. **Other Practices**: True
3. **Policy Change**: True
4. **First Party Collection/Use**: True
5. **Data Retention**: False
6. **International and Specific Audiences**: True (since it mentions California without excluding other regions)
7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
8. **User Choice/Control**: False (no direct user control beyond contacting for management)
9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: True (users can access via contact methods provided)
10. **Data Security**: False
11. **Do Not Track**: False

**Final Evaluation:**

- Data: true  
- Other: true  
- Policy Change: true  
- First Party Collection/Use: true  
- Data Retention: false  
- International and Specific Audiences: true  
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
- User Choice/Control: false  
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: true  
- Data Security: false  
- Do Not Track: false
