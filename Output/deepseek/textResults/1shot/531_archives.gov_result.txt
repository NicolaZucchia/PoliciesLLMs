Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, I have a privacy policy provided, and I need to evaluate each of the specified categories based on whether they are affected or not by a potential policy change.

First, I'll read through the Privacy Policy document carefully to identify how Personal Information is collected, used, retained, shared, etc. Then, for each category in the expected output—Data Collection, Data Use, Data Retention, Third-Party Sharing, User Choice, etc.—I need to determine if any of these practices have changed or if they are still as described.

Starting with "Data: Answer"—this seems like it's asking about personal data collection. In the policy, NOTMC collects Personal Information through their Online Services, including First and Third Party interactions. So this is true.

Next, "Other" probably refers to non-personally identifiable information or cookies. Since they use cookies and other tracking technologies, which are necessary for functionality but not personally identifying, this would also be true.

Then, "Policy Change"—this likely asks if there's any mention of a change in their privacy practices. Scanning through the policy, I don't see any statements indicating that policies have changed recently. So, Policy Change is false.

Moving to "First Party Collection/Use"—they collect information directly from users visiting their sites or interacting with their services, so this is true.

Data Retention—"How long do they keep this information?" The policy doesn't specify a retention period beyond what's necessary for user experience and marketing. It seems indefinite, but the policy mentions not retaining unnecessary data, which aligns with good privacy practices. However, since the exact retention period isn't specified, I'll consider it as not explicitly stating a change, so maybe Data Retention is true if they continue their current practices.

International and Specific Audiences—"Do they target non-USA users?" The policy doesn't mention anything about targeting specific audiences outside the USA, so this might be false unless they inherently serve international users without targeting.

Third Party Sharing/Collection—"Do they share data with third parties for marketing?" Yes, they do use cookies and partner with third-party advertising networks, which means sharing aggregated data. So, Third Party Sharing is true.

User Choice/Control—"Do they give users control over their data?" They mention "Your California Privacy Rights" and offer to delete information, indicating user choice exists. So this is true.

User Access, Edit and Deletion—"Can users access, edit or delete their data?" The policy doesn't explicitly say whether users can do so through an interface. Without clear instructions or permissions from the site, it's safer to assume that access might be limited, making User Access, etc., false.

Data Security—"Are they secure?" They mention using cookies and encryption technologies but don't go into detail about their security measures' strength. So Data Security is true if these measures are sufficient as per current standards, which I'll tentatively say yes.

Do Not Track—"Does the policy comply with Do Not Track signals?" The policy doesn't explicitly state adherence to DNT signals beyond what's standard for cookies, so this might be false unless they have implemented specific DNT mechanisms.

Putting it all together based on my analysis: 

Data Collection is true since they collect personal info. Data Use is also true as they use it for marketing and tracking. Third-Party Sharing is definitely true because of the ad partners. User Choice exists, so that's true. However, without explicit information about user access, edit, or deletion options, those would be false.

So, the final evaluation based on my analysis matches the initial assessment except perhaps for Data Retention where I might have been uncertain but leaning towards it being true if retention continues as per policy.

Based on the thorough analysis of the provided Privacy Policy document and evaluating each category against the potential policy change:

- **Data: Answer**: True
- **Other**: True
- **Policy Change**: False
- **First Party Collection/Use**: True
- **Data Retention**: True (Assuming continuation of current practices)
- **International and Specific Audiences**: False (No mention of targeting non-USA users)
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: True
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False (No explicit user control mechanisms mentioned)
- **Data Security**: True (Assuming sufficient security measures as per current standards)
- **Do Not Track**: False (No explicit DNT compliance mentioned)

**Final Answer:**

Data: true  
Other: true  
Policy Change: false  
First Party Collection/Use: true  
Data Retention: true  
International and Specific Audiences: false  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
User Choice/Control: true  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: false  
Data Security: true  
Do Not Track: false
