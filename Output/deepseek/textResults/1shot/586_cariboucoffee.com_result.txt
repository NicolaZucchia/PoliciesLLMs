Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to evaluate whether certain aspects of a privacy policy meet specific criteria. The user has provided the entire privacy policy text, which is quite lengthy. They then want me to determine if each of the specified aspects—Data Collection, Data Use, Data Retention, International Audience, Third Party Sharing, User Choice, Access/Edit/Delete, Security, and Do Not Track—are true or false based on this policy.

First, I'll go through each criterion one by one and check them against the privacy policy text. Let's start with "Data: Answer" which is a placeholder for the response. The user expects me to output either Data (if it applies), Answer, Other, or Policy Change—probably referring to if any parts of the policy have changed.

1. **Data Collection**: I need to check if NOTMC collects personal information from users. Looking at the policy, they mention collecting data through cookies and third-party services but don't specify individual user input like passwords or email addresses. So this might be false unless it's implied they do collect such data for something else.

2. **First Party Collection/Use**: This refers to using the user's own information collected directly by NOTMC. The policy says they use cookies and third-party data, which could imply that while they don't collect first-party data themselves, they might use it for their own purposes.

3. **Data Retention**: The policy mentions storing cookies but doesn't specify how long they keep these. Since the user didn't set a time frame, I can assume false on this unless they clarify the duration.

4. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy is written in English without any mention of targeting individuals outside the US or specific demographics beyond New Orleans, so this should be true if it's only for a U.S. audience but might not meet international standards.

5. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: They do share data with third-party advertising partners, as mentioned in the online advertising section, which makes this true.

6. **User Choice/Control**: The policy talks about user ability to manage cookies and opt-out of tracking through settings links, so this is likely true.

7. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: There's no mention of how users can access, edit, or delete their data, which might imply it's false unless the policy explicitly states otherwise.

8. **Data Security**: They do have measures against data breaches but don't mention specific security technologies like encryption, so this might be false.

9. **Do Not Track**: The policy mentions using cookies for advertising and tracking user actions but doesn't explicitly say they don't track users in general, which could mean it's false unless specified otherwise.

Now, thinking about the expected output format: Data is a placeholder, Answer refers to whether there are any changes from the current state, Other might be true if none apply, Policy Change indicates if aspects have changed. The other criteria need to be evaluated as true or false based on my analysis.

The evaluation of the privacy policy aspects yields the following:

- **Data Collection**: False (NOTMC primarily collects data through cookies and third-party services without direct user input like passwords).
- **First Party Collection/Use**: True (They use personal information but don't explicitly collect first-party data directly from users).
- **Data Retention**: False (No explicit timeframe for retaining cookies is provided).
- **International and Specific Audiences**: False (The policy targets New Orleans without international scope or specific demographic targeting beyond the U.S.).
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True (They share data with third-party advertising partners).
- **User Choice/Control**: True (Users can manage cookie settings through provided links).
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False (No mention of access, edit, or deletion options for user data).
- **Data Security**: False (No specific security measures like encryption are mentioned).
- **Do Not Track**: False (The policy doesn't explicitly state "do not track" mechanisms).

Answer: Data is a placeholder. Answer indicates no changes unless specified elsewhere.

Other considerations:
- **Policy Change**: The policy itself hasn't changed; it's provided as the current state.
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: Users likely don't have access to their data without more specific policies.

The expected output format should reflect these evaluations accordingly.
