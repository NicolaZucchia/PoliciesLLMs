Okay, so I have this problem where I need to evaluate a complex legal text about a company's privacy policy and map it to specific criteria. The expected output is a set of boolean values corresponding to 14 different aspects. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the input provided is a lengthy English document that outlines how NOTMC handles user data. It covers topics like cookies, advertising, third-party services, consent, and more. My task is to determine whether each of the specified criteria applies based on this policy.

Let's list out the criteria I need to check:

1. Data: Does NOTMC collect user data?
2. Other: Is there any other information that doesn't fall into specific categories.
3. Policy Change: Does the policy mention anything about changes or updates?
4. First Party Collection/Use: Do they handle their own data?
5. Data Retention: How long do they keep user data?
6. International and Specific Audiences: Are they targeting a specific international audience?
7. Third Party Sharing/Collection: Do they share/collate data with third parties.
8. User Choice/Control: Does the policy give users control over their data?
9. User Access, Edit and Deletion: Can users access, edit, or delete their data?
10. Data Security: How secure is their data storage?
11. Do Not Track: Does the policy mention user tracking features?

Now, looking at the privacy policy:

- **Data Collection**: The policy mentions collecting information through cookies, online purchases, and user interactions. So they do collect data.
  
  - Data: true

- **Other Information**: It seems comprehensive but doesn't cover every possible area. There's no mention of other info like IP addresses or financial details beyond what’s covered.

  - Other: true (since it covers some aspects not explicitly mentioned elsewhere)

- **Policy Change**: The policy is presented as a document, implying it might have updates. It doesn’t specify if changes are documented or how often they occur.

  - Policy Change: true

- **First Party Use**: They use the data themselves for improving services and marketing.

  - First Party Collection/Use: true

- **Data Retention**: The policy mentions cookies with a lifetime but doesn't specify retention periods beyond that. So unclear if data is retained beyond session.

  - Data Retention: Hmm, the policy says nothing about how long they keep user data beyond what's in the cookie lifecycle. Since cookies typically have an expiration, maybe considered as no retention? Or perhaps retention for limited time. The answer here is false because it doesn't specify, but since cookies are mentioned, maybe it's not false.

  - Data Retention: false (since it’s unclear and they might delete data beyond session)

Wait, actually, in the policy, under "Cookies," they say lifetime of a cookie typically, so probably they don't retain beyond that. So likely:

- Data Retention: false

But to be cautious, since some policies have explicit retention periods, I'll go with false because it's not specified here.

Next:

- **International Audience**: It mentions California rights but no specific international targeting.

  - International and Specific Audiences: The policy doesn't target a specific international audience beyond general users. So true only if they do so, which isn’t clear.

  Wait, the policy is in English, so maybe it's used internationally, but without explicit mention of targeting specific countries like GDPR regions, it’s not specifically for international audiences.

- **Third Party Sharing**: They use cookies and pixels with third-party services. So yes.

  - Third Party Sharing/Collection: true

- **User Choice/Control**: The policy mentions consent (clicking/telling), Do Not Track requests, and California rights—so users have some control.

  - User Choice/Control: true

- **Access/Edit/Delete**: The policy says cookies can be managed via browser settings. No direct info on editing or deleting data from server side? Maybe false because it's only about user actions like managing preferences, not server-level access.

  Wait, they do give users a way to delete their information (for children) and mention consent but don't say how users can edit personal info beyond cookies. So likely:

  - User Access, Edit and Deletion: false

But wait, the policy mentions user consent for data use but doesn’t specify if users can view or edit all their data themselves or just manage preferences.

- **Data Security**: They mention cookies are not always secure but do suggest users should keep antivirus software updated. So partial security measures.

  - Data Security: true (they have some security measures, even if flawed)

- **Do Not Track**: The policy mentions user can opt out via browser settings and makes inquiries to a specific email for marketing purposes—so they support DNT features.

  - Do Not Track: true

Wait, but in the initial mapping, I marked it as false. Let me correct that:

Looking back, the policy states that users can make inquiries (which is like providing feedback) which might not be a full DNT feature. So perhaps:

- Do Not Track: They don't have an opt-out mechanism beyond general user interaction.

  - Do Not Track: false

Wait, the policy doesn’t mention any tracking beyond cookies and pixels. So maybe they do track via these means but don't have a full DNT implementation.

So finalizing each point with careful consideration:

1. Data: true
2. Other: true (covers some aspects)
3. Policy Change: true (not sure about updates, so likely yes as a policy document could be updated)
4. First Party Use: true
5. Data Retention: false (no explicit retention period)
6. International and Specific Audiences: false (no specific international targeting mentioned)
7. Third Party Sharing: true
8. User Choice/Control: true
9. User Access, Edit and Deletion: false (only via browser settings, not server-level access)
10. Data Security: true
11. Do Not Track: false

Wait, I'm a bit confused about point 6. If the policy is used internationally but doesn’t target specific countries beyond general users, then no.

So final answer:

Data: true  
Other: true  
Policy Change: true  
First Party Use: true  
Data Retention: false  
International and Specific Audiences: false  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
User Choice/Control: true  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: false  
Data Security: true  
Do Not Track: false

But looking back at the initial mapping provided by the user:

The expected output is 14 booleans. Wait, in the question, it's mapped as Data to Do Not Track (14 points). Let me check.

Yes, exactly 14 criteria. So each of them needs a true or false based on my analysis above.

So I'll present it accordingly.

Here is the evaluation of the privacy policy against the specified criteria:

1. **Data**: true  
2. **Other**: true  
3. **Policy Change**: true  
4. **First Party Collection/Use**: true  
5. **Data Retention**: false  
6. **International and Specific Audiences**: false  
7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: true  
8. **User Choice/Control**: true  
9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: false  
10. **Data Security**: true  
11. **Do Not Track**: false  

The final mapping is as follows:

- Data: true  
- Other: true  
- Policy Change: true  
- First Party Collection/Use: true  
- Data Retention: false  
- International and Specific Audiences: false  
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
- User Choice/Control: true  
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: false  
- Data Security: true  
- Do Not Track: false  

This evaluation reflects the assessment based on the content of the privacy policy provided.
