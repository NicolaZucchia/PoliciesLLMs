Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to determine the truth value for each of the specified categories based on the provided privacy policy text. 

First, I'll go through each category one by one.

1. **Data Collection**: The policy mentions collecting Personal Information and data about users when they use the Online Services. So this should be true.

2. **Data Retention**: The policy talks about storing cookies and information to improve online experiences but doesn't specify how long data is retained beyond that. However, since it's part of normal operations, I'll consider this as true.

3. **International Scope**: The policy states that the English version is used everywhere without translation issues elsewhere, so international application applies here: true.

4. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy mentions sharing data with third-party advertising partners and social networking sites, so it's definitely true.

5. **User Choice/Control**: There are some sections about user control, like opting out of certain cookies or managing settings through browsers, which suggests users have some control: true.

6. **Do Not Track**: The policy doesn't mention any mechanisms for tracking browser interactions like ad blockers, so this is false.

7. **Data Security**: It mentions using cookies to track actions and improve services but also notes that no system can be 100% secure, so security measures are in place: true.

8. **Third Party Sharing/Collection (redundant check)**: Confirmed again as true.

9. **User Access, Edit, Deletion**: The policy allows users to contact for deletions and has information on managing cookies via browsers, indicating they can access or delete their data: true.

10. **Data Security**: This was already confirmed earlier but is still relevant.

The analysis of the provided privacy policy indicates that most categories related to user interactions and policies are addressed truthfully based on the content of the text.

**Answer**
- Data: true
- Other: false (as per the initial statement, this might not be applicable)
- Policy Change: true
- First Party Collection/Use: true
- Data Retention: true
- International and Specific Audiences: true
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
- User Choice/Control: true
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: true
- Data Security: true
- Do Not Track: false

The answer is structured as a JSON with each category's truth value based on the analysis.

```json
