Alright, so I have to figure out whether each of the 14 specified aspects applies to this privacy policy. Let's go through them one by one.

1. **Data Collection**: The policy talks about collecting Personal Information like name, phone number, address via forms and sign-ups. So yes, Data Collection is true.

2. **First Party Collection/Use**: It mentions using the collected data for marketing purposes without third parties initially, so that's a yes.

3. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy does mention sharing with advertising partners and using cookies set by others, so this is definitely true.

4. **Data Retention**: The policy states they keep information until deletion but doesn't specify how long, just "until you notify us." So I think Data Retention should be considered true as it involves storage.

5. **International Audience**: The policy is in English and mentions California privacy rights and a contact address in New Orleans, so yes to international or specific audiences.

6. **User Choice/Control**: There's no mention of users being able to opt-in/out or manage preferences, so this would be false.

7. **Do Not Track**: The policy doesn't reference cookies for tracking user activity in terms of blocking ads, so Do Not Track is false.

8. **Data Security**: They do mention measures to secure information but don't specify technical security details like encryption, so I'm not sure on this one—maybe true as they do have some safeguards.

9. **User Access/Edit/Deletion**: The policy doesn’t provide info on how users can access or change their data, so this is false.

10. **Cookies Use**: Yes, it talks about cookies for tracking and preferences but no details on functionality beyond that.

11. **Privacy Rights (California)**: Yes, there's a section about California rights to inspect marketing data.

12. **Children’s Privacy**: It states they don’t target children under 13 and require users over 13 to provide info, so this is true.

13. **Third Party Websites/Links**: When linking to other sites through social media or links on their site, third parties are involved. So yes.

14. **Social Media and Third Parties**: Yes, because they link externally, which implies using third party services with similar privacy practices.

Wait, but for some aspects like User Choice and Data Security, I'm less certain since details aren't provided in the policy.
