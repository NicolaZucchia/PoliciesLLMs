Alright, let me try to figure out what the user is asking for here. They provided a lengthy privacy policy from NOTMC and an expected output with several boolean flags indicating certain aspects of the policy.

First, I need to understand each part of their query. The user wants to know if specific features are present in the given privacy policy. Each flag corresponds to a different aspect: Data Collection, Policy Change, First Party Collection/Use, etc.

Looking at the expected output they provided, it's all boolean flags (Data, Other, Policy Change, etc.), but in their query, each line starts with "Expected Output:" followed by three lines of data. Wait, maybe that was a formatting issue. It seems like they just want to know which aspects are present or not.

I'll go through the provided privacy policy step by step and check for each aspect:

1. **Data**: The policy mentions collecting personal information about visitors.
2. **Other**: There's a section on California Privacy Rights, so this would fall under Other.
3. **Policy Change**: The policy doesn't mention anything about changing policies or updates, so Policy Change is false.
4. **First Party Collection/Use**: It talks about using data collected from visitors to manage online services and marketing, which involves the first party.
5. **Data Retention**: There's no mention of how long data is kept, so this is false.
6. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy does have a section for California residents, indicating specific audiences, but it also talks about international aspects as well.
7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy mentions cookies and third-party advertising, so this is true.
8. **User Choice/Control**: There's a part where users can request information under California laws, implying they have control.
9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy doesn't specify if users can access or delete their data; that's more about the user's rights than what the company does with their data.
10. **Data Security**: It mentions using cookies but doesn't detail security measures beyond general statements, so this is false.
11. **Do Not Track**: The policy talks about cookies and tracking but doesn't explicitly mention a Do Not Track mechanism.

So putting it all together, the boolean flags would reflect which aspects are true or false based on the above analysis.

The answer for each aspect is as follows:

- Data: True
- Other: True
- Policy Change: False
- First Party Collection/Use: True
- Data Retention: False
- International and Specific Audiences: True
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: True
- User Choice/Control: True
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: False
- Data Security: False
- Do Not Track: False

Answer: true, true, false, true, false, true, true, true, false, false, false
