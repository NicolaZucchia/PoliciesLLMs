Alright, I need to analyze the given policy text to determine which of the expected outputs are correct. The user has provided a detailed privacy policy from NOTMC regarding their data collection, use, retention, third-party sharing, etc.

First, I'll go through each line and identify if it relates to any of the expected categories: Data, Other, Policy Change, First Party Collection/Use, Data Retention, International and Specific Audiences, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Choice/Control, User Access, Edit and Deletion, Data Security, Do Not Track.

Looking at the policy:

1. **Data Collection**: The policy mentions collecting personal information through online services. This would fall under First Party Collection.
2. **User Interaction**: Users can choose not to receive marketing through opt-out links or by unsubscribing via email, which relates to User Choice/Control.
3. **Cookies and Tracking**: Use of cookies for improving experience and tracking actions implies Data Security as they protect user data.

Negative aspects like Do Not Track are mentioned, but it's unclear if the policy actively implements it, so I'll mark that as false.

The policy also mentions third-party advertising, which means Third Party Sharing/Collection is true. There's no mention of international policies other than specifying English usage, so International and Specific Audiences could be considered true for language consistency across regions.

Regarding data retention, the policy doesn't specify how long user information is kept beyond necessary, but it does say to notify upon request if compromised. So Data Retention: false unless they have a clear retention period mentioned elsewhere, which isn't in the provided text.

For Third Party Sharing/Collection, yes, because of the third-party ads and cookies used by NOTMC.

- **International and Specific Audiences**: Yes
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: Yes

- **Do Not Track**: No
