Okay, I need to analyze this user query about a privacy policy. The user provided the text of the NOTMC Privacy Policy and expects an evaluation of certain aspects like Data Collection, Policy Change, etc.

First, I'll go through each of the expected output points one by one.

1. **Data**: This likely refers to personal data collected. Looking at the policy, it does mention collecting personal information such as first-party data (e.g., user interactions) and third-party cookies for advertising purposes. So Data is true.

2. **Policy Change**: The policy doesn't state that privacy practices will change, so Policy Change should be false.

3. **First Party Collection/Use**: The policy talks about collecting data from their own services, which means it's used in those same platforms. That makes First Party Collection/Use true.

4. **Data Retention**: It seems the policy doesn't set specific retention periods beyond what is necessary for privacy and security. So Data Retention might be false as there's no mention of duration beyond standard practices.

5. **International and Specific Audiences**: Since it's a US company focusing on New Orleans, it likely serves international audiences through its presence there. So this should be true.

6. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy does mention sharing data with third-party advertising partners, so Third Party Sharing is true.

7. **User Choice/Control**: It allows users to opt out of marketing via email and phone, indicating User Choice exists, so this is true.

8. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: There's no clear instruction on how users can access or delete their data beyond the contact information, making User Access etc., false.

9. **Data Security**: The policy mentions security measures but doesn't specify technical details like encryption. So Data Security is true if it implies some level of protection.

10. **Do Not Track**: There's no mention of tracking technologies in the policy provided, so this would be false.

I think that covers all points.
