Okay, so I need to analyze this privacy policy text and determine which of the given expected outputs are correct. The expected outputs include things like Data collection, First party collection, etc., up to specific aspects like Do not track. Each is marked as either Data (true or false), Policy Change (true or false), and so on.

First, I'll read through the provided privacy policy carefully to extract information about each of these areas.

Starting with "Data: Answer". The policy mentions that Personal Information is collected, such as names, addresses, phone numbers, etc., when users request information. So Data collection is true.

Next, "Policy Change: true". Since it's a policy document, there must be provisions for changes, so this should be true.

"First Party Collection/Use: true". The policy states that NOTMC collects and uses information on their own websites, so yes, first-party data is collected and used.

Data Retention is marked as false. The policy doesn't specify how long personal information is kept; it seems to focus more on collection than retention periods, so I think this should be false.

International and Specific Audiences: true because the policy mentions California Privacy Rights for individuals there and does not target children under 13.

Third Party Sharing/Collection: true. The policy talks about third-party cookies and clear GIFs used in advertising, indicating that NOTMC shares data with these parties.

User Choice/Control: true. It mentions users being able to contact for privacy inquiries and lists California Shine the Light rights, so there's some control aspect.

User Access, Edit and Deletion: true. The policy allows users to access their personal information if they request it and mentions deletion upon inquiry.

Data Security: true because NOTMC uses cookies and other measures, though no 100% security is guaranteed, as mentioned.

Do Not Track: false. There's no mention of DO_NOT_TRACK or any tracking technologies in the policy.

I should cross-verify each point to ensure accuracy based on the text provided.
