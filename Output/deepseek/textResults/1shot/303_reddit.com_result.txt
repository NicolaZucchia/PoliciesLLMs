Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether the given Privacy Policy meets certain criteria. The user has provided a set of expected outputs related to data collection, retention, third-party sharing, etc., each marked as Data, Other, Policy Change, etc.

First, let me parse through the Privacy Policy carefully. It mentions that NOTMC collects personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails for business purposes (lines like "We collect this information to facilitate..." and "Your personal information will be used..."). So that's a confirmation of data collection for first-party use.

Next, looking at data retention: the policy states it keeps data until necessary for compliance or 3 years after the last activity. But in the expected output, Data Retention is marked as false, which I think might mean they don't collect data for more than a certain period. Wait, no, actually, according to the policy, it's kept longer than othersâ€”so maybe that doesn't fit "Data Retention" being false.

Third-party sharing: the policy mentions sharing data with third parties like advertisers and agents (lines about "our advertising management partners"). So Third Party Sharing/Collection is true.

User Choice/Control: I see mentions of user opting out for cookies through settings, so User Choice/Control should be true.

User Access, Edit, Deletion: The policy allows users to manage cookies via browser settings but doesn't explicitly say you can delete accounts. However, it does mention contacting to remove personal info, which might imply some level of control, though not full access. So I think this is true.

Data Security: The policy talks about security measures like antivirus software and advises updating them, so Data Security is marked as true.

Do Not Track: The policy doesn't mention any specific DNT features or mechanisms for opting out of tracking ads beyond what's standard in the industry. Therefore, Do Not Track should be false.

Looking back at Policy Change: Since there are no mentions of changes to the policy being required by law or regulation, this is probably true as it hasn't been updated recently.

Putting it all together, I think each expected output aligns with the provided Privacy Policy except for Data Retention and Do Not Track.

The analysis confirms that the given data from the Privacy Policy matches the criteria with minor exceptions noted. Here's a structured summary:

- **Data Collection/Use**: True
- **Data Retention**: Partially true, but due to the policy's retention period being longer than others, it might not fit "Data Retention" as per the initial assumption.
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: True
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: True (with minor caveats)
- **Data Security**: True
- **Do Not Track**: False
- **Policy Change**: True

In summary:

- Data: True
- Other: True
- Policy Change: True
- First Party Collection/Use: True
- Data Retention: Partially true, depending on interpretation.
- International and Specific Audiences: True
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: True
- User Choice/Control: True
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: True (with minor caveats)
- Data Security: True
- Do Not Track: False

This aligns with the expected outputs except for the nuances in Data Retention.
