Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to evaluate a given text against several specific criteria. The text is a privacy policy for NOTMC, which outlines their information practices. The task is to determine whether each of the eight specified areas (Data, Other, Policy Change, First Party Collection/Use, Data Retention, International and Specific Audiences, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Choice/Control, User Access, Edit and Deletion, Data Security, Do Not Track) apply or not. 

First, I'll start by reading through the provided privacy policy to understand what NOTMC collects, uses, and shares about their users. Then, I'll go through each criterion one by one to see if they're applicable.

The text starts by mentioning that the policy applies to anyone using the NOTMC website or mobile application (app). It states that personal information is collected for online booking and management services related to events in New Orleans, including ticketing, event planning, and room reservations. This suggests that they collect data specifically for business purposes related to events in a particular region.

Next, it talks about cookies being used to improve user experience, track online purchases, and manage advertising through third-party services. It also mentions social networking features but clarifies that users should consult the privacy policies of third-party sites. There's a section about California privacy rights, allowing residents to request information shared with marketers, which points towards specific audience considerations.

Regarding data collection, they mention cookies, event-related data, and third-party tracking technologies like clear GIFs. They don't target children under 13, so the children's privacy policy doesn't apply here. 

Now, I'll evaluate each criterion:

1. **Data Collection**: The text describes that personal information is collected for specific event-related purposes, not as a general data collection by an entity of unknown size, nature, and scope. So this might be considered true if they do collect data from users.

2. **Other**: They provide contact information but don't specify other parties beyond the third-party services mentioned.

3. **Policy Change**: The policy doesn't mention any specific steps to update or change privacy practices upon request, so this is likely false.

4. **First Party Collection/Use**: Data is collected from users using their website/app for event management, which is first-party data collection and use.

5. **Data Retention**: There's no information on how long personal information is retained beyond what's necessary for the stated purposes, so it's unclear but possibly true if they follow standard practices.

6. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy mentions California users having specific rights and does not target children under 13, which fits with specific audiences.

7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: They do share data through third-party services for marketing purposes, so this is definitely true.

8. **User Choice/Control**: There's no mention of user preferences or control over data collection or sharing, making this false.

9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy doesn't provide any mechanisms for users to access, edit, or delete their information, so this is false.

10. **Data Security**: The text mentions that NOTMC uses cookies but doesn't specify any security measures beyond what's standard practice, making it unclear if data security practices are detailed here.

11. **Do Not Track**: The policy does not address users' requests to opt out of tracking or targeted advertising, so this is false.

Putting it all together, I'll map each criterion based on the analysis.

Data: True  
Other: Unclear (but mentions third-party services)  
Policy Change: False  
First Party Collection/Use: True  
Data Retention: Unclear  
International and Specific Audiences: True  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: True  
User Choice/Control: False  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: False  
Data Security: Unclear  
Do Not Track: False  

Based on the analysis, here is the evaluation for each criterion:

- **Data**: True
- **Other**: Unclear (Mentions third-party services but lacks specific details)
- **Policy Change**: False
- **First Party Collection/Use**: True
- **Data Retention**: Unclear (No specifics provided)
- **International and Specific Audiences**: True
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: False
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False
- **Data Security**: Unclear (Doesn't specify details on security measures)
- **Do Not Track**: False

The final answer is:

```
{
  "Data": true,
  "Other": true,
  "Policy Change": false,
  "First Party Collection/Use": true,
  "Data Retention": true,
  "International and Specific Audiences": true,
  "Third Party Sharing/Collection": true,
  "User Choice/Control": false,
  "User Access, Edit and Deletion": false,
  "Data Security": true,
  "Do Not Track": false
}
```
