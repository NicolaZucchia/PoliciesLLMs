Okay, so I need to figure out whether each of the 14 points in the given policy document corresponds to the expected output's data, other, policy change, first party collection/use, etc. The user has provided an expected output with four categories and their corresponding boolean values.

First, I'll go through each point one by one and see how they fit into these categories.

1. **The following are the terms of use for Not MC...**
   - This is more like a general policy statement rather than specific data points. It doesn't directly address collection or usage beyond what's already detailed in other sections.
   - So, it likely falls under "Other".

2. **This English-language Privacy Policy is NOTMC's official statement of our privacy practices.**
   - Again, this seems to be a general statement about the policy rather than specific data points.
   - This would also fall under "Other".

3. **NOTMC does not target children...**
   - This pertains to age restrictions on information collection.
   - This relates to "User Age Restrictions" which isn't directly listed in the expected output, but it's about what type of data is collected.

4. **When a user discloses personal information on our Online Services, the user is representing to us that he or she is at least thirteen (13) years of age.**
   - This sets an age threshold for information sharing.
   - This could fall under "User Age Restrictions" but since it's not listed in the expected output categories, maybe it's part of "Other".

5. **If you are the parent or guardian of a child under the age of thirteen (13), who you believe has provided NOTMC with personally identifiable information through our Online Services, please e-mail us at online@notmc.com so that we can delete the child's information from our records.**
   - This gives parents an option to control their child's data.
   - This relates to "User Choice/Control", but it's more specific than a general choice, so maybe it falls under "Other".

6. **NOTMC and its agents use Cookies...**
   - This is about the collection of information (cookies) for tracking and preference setting.
   - This directly corresponds to "First Party Collection/Use".

7. **Cookies are not themselves personally identifiable, but may be linked to Personal Information that you provide to us through your interaction with our Online Services.**
   - Explains how cookies are used, which is part of "First Party Collection/Use".
   - This supports the previous point.

8. **NOTMC also uses Cookies...**
   - Reiterates the use of cookies for tracking and advertising.
   - Again, this falls under "First Party Collection/Use".

9. **Web browsers allow some control of most Cookies. Please consult your particular Web browser's settings.**
   - This is about user control over cookies but not directly about collection or usage data.
   - It might be part of "User Access, Edit and Deletion", so maybe it falls under that.

10. **NOTMC uses Cookies...**
    - Further emphasis on cookies for improving online experience and tracking.
    - Still relates to "First Party Collection/Use".

11. **Cookies also enable us to track online purchases made through our Online Services.**
    - This is about a specific use of cookies beyond just preference setting or advertising.
    - So, it's another instance of "First Party Collection/Use".

12. **NOTMC and its agents use Cookies...**
    - Reiterates cookie usage but more specifically for tracking purchases.
    - Again, part of "First Party Collection/Use".

13. **Social Networking and Third Party Sites**
    - This is about third-party interactions, so it relates to "Third Party Sharing/Collection".
    - Since the policy mentions not being responsible for their practices, this makes sense.

14. **NOTMC also uses Cookies...**
    - Further confirmation of cookie usage.
    - Part of "First Party Collection/Use".

Now, looking at each category in the expected output:

- **Data:** Any point that talks about data collection or storage would be marked as Data: true. From the analysis above, points 6,7,8,10,11, and 12 are about cookies, which collect data (cookies store user preferences). So "Data" should be true.

- **Other:** Points like general statements in 1, 2, 5, etc., fall under Other: true.

- **Policy Change:** Any points that talk about potential policy changes or updates. The document doesn't mention any future changes, so Policy Change is false.

- **First Party Collection/Use:** Points where data is collected directly from the user and used by NOTMC themselves. That's 6,8,10,11,12: First Party: true.

- **Data Retention:** Any points about how long data is stored. The document mentions nothing on retention periods, so Data Retention: false.

- **User Age Restrictions:** Points that set an age threshold for information sharing (point 4). Since it's not in the expected output categories, maybe "Other" applies here instead of User Age.

Wait, but looking back, I might have misclassified point 5 under "Other". It's more about a user's right to delete their child's data, which is a form of control. So perhaps points related to age are under "User Age Restrictions", but since that category isn't listed in the expected output, maybe it falls under "Other".

Similarly, the policy doesn't mention anything about data retention beyond what's implied by using cookies and tracking, so Data Retention: false.

Putting this together:

Data: true (due to points 6-12 about cookies)

Other: true (general statements and some control aspects)

Policy Change: false

First Party Collection/Use: true

Data Retention: false
</think>

Based on the analysis of each point in the policy document, here is the evaluation against the expected output categories:

- **Data:** True (Cookies are used for data collection)
- **Other:** True (General statements and control aspects not directly tied to data points)
- **Policy Change:** False (No mention of potential changes)
- **First Party Collection/Use:** True (Cookies collected by NOTMC)
- **Data Retention:** False (No information on retention periods)

**Final Answer:**

| Category   | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Data       | true  |
| Other      | true  |
| Policy Change | false |
| First Party Collection/Use | true |
| Data Retention | false |
