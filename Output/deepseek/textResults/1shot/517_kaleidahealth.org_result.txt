Alright, let me try to figure this out. I need to go through each of the categories one by one based on the provided privacy policy text. The user gave an expected output with some fields marked as "Data", "Other", "Policy Change", etc., and they want me to determine if each category applies (mark it as true) or not apply (mark false). 

First, I'll start reading through the text carefully.

1. **Data Collection**: The policy mentions collecting personal information such as name, address, phone number, email, and financial info like credit card numbers and payment history. So Data is definitely being collected here.

2. **Other Rights and Interests**: It talks about cookies, online advertising, social networking links, etc., but not much about other rights like products or services provided beyond the stated ones. I'm not sure if "Other" applies here as it's more about what's mentioned rather than a broad category.

3. **Policy Change**: The policy states that all policies are subject to change by posting on the website and that users should check periodically. So Policy Change is true.

4. **First Party Collection/Use**: It explains how Personal Information is collected (cookie preferences, account info) and used (tracking user interactions, marketing). This falls under First Party, so it's true.

5. **Data Retention**: I don't see any mention of how long the data is kept or if there's a retention policy beyond general data security measures. Since it's not specified, Data Retention should be false.

6. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy mentions California privacy rights but doesn't address international users or specific audiences outside of the stated ones. So this category applies only in specific cases (California), making International and Specific Audiences true for general purposes but perhaps more nuanced here.

7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy talks about sharing with advertising partners, third-party services, etc., so Third Party is definitely involved.

8. **User Choice/Control**: There's a mention of users exercising their rights via email, which implies some control over their personal info. So User Choice is true.

9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy allows users to contact for deletions but doesn't specify if they can access or edit their own data directly through the platform. Without explicit information on editing themselves, I'm unsure. It's not a clear yes or no.

10. **Data Security**: The policy states that NOTMC takes measures to secure Personal Information and advises users to use antivirus software. This points towards Data Security being true.

11. **Do Not Track**: There's nothing about Do Not Track mechanisms in the text provided, so this is false.

Putting it all together based on these analyses.
