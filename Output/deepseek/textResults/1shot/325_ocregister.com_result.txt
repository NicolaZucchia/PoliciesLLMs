Alright, let me try to figure this out. So the user provided a detailed privacy policy for NOTMC, and they want to extract specific data points based on certain categories like Data Collection, First Party Collection/Use, etc. 

First, I need to understand what each category means in the context of the privacy policy.

- **Data Collection**: This would include any information that is gathered about users.
- **First Party Collection/Use**: Information collected directly from NOTMC's website or application.
- **Data Retention**: How long the company keeps user data.
- **International and Specific Audiences**: If the company serves users outside of their home country or has tailored audiences based on location.
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: Data shared with other companies.
- **User Choice/Control**: Whether users can manage their personal information.
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: Options for users to view, change, or delete their data.
- **Data Security**: Measures the company takes to protect user data.
- **Do Not Track**: If the company implements DNT policies.

Looking at the provided policy:

1. The policy mentions cookies are used to track actions and improve experiences. So Data Collection is true because they gather data via cookies.

2. The policy talks about collecting information like name, address, phone number through interactions with their services. That means First Party Collection/Use is true.

3. It says NOTMC does not retain personal information indefinitely but doesn't specify the duration, so I'm unsure if Data Retention should be true or false. Maybe it's partially true since they do store some info but don't know exactly how long.

4. The policy mentions California privacy rights and handling children under 13 separately, indicating they do cater to specific audiences, especially in California. So International and Specific Audiences is true.

5. They do share data with advertising partners, which are third parties, so Third Party Sharing/Collection is true.

6. Users can contact NOTMC via email or phone if they have questions about their personal information, showing User Choice/Control is true.

7. The policy doesn't mention how users access, edit, or delete their data—cookie settings and contact info are provided but not full control options—so maybe this is false unless we infer from the Contact Us section.

8. They use cookies to track user actions for security purposes, so Data Security is true.

9. Do Not Track isn't explicitly mentioned in the policy, so it's probably false.

Putting it all together:
- Data Collection: True
- First Party Collection/Use: True
- Data Retention: Partially true but not fully specified, maybe considered true.
- International and Specific Audiences: True
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: True
- User Choice/Control: True
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: Not explicitly mentioned, so false.
- Data Security: True
- Do Not Track: False

But in the initial response, I had Data Retention as false because it's unclear. However, considering they do store some information for marketing purposes, maybe it should be true. Maybe adjust that.

Wait, looking again: The policy says NOTMC doesn't target children under 13 and does not knowingly collect such info from them. So no data retention issues regarding minors. For adults, Data Retention is unclear since it's about how long they keep the information. If they use cookies with expiration dates (common practice), maybe they have a way to limit retention, so perhaps Data Retention: True as they do retain some data.

But in the initial answer, I had Data Retention: false, which might be incorrect if considering typical practices where companies often retain some info for limited periods. Maybe keep it as true.

So final adjustments:
- Data Collection: True
- First Party Collection/Use: True
- Data Retention: True (assuming they do have retention policies)
- International and Specific Audiences: True
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: True
- User Choice/Control: True
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: Not explicitly stated but Contact Us info is provided; perhaps false.
- Data Security: True
- Do Not Track: False

Wait, the initial answer had Data Retention as false. Maybe stick with that since it's not explicitly mentioned in the policy about retention period.

So final categorization:
Data Collection: true
First Party Collection/Use: true
Data Retention: false
International and Specific Audiences: true
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
User Choice/Control: true
User Access, Edit and Deletion: not explicitly stated—probably false.
Data Security: true
Do Not Track: false

Yes, that makes sense. So the initial answer was mostly correct except Data Retention which I initially thought should be true but concluded as false based on policy lack of specifics about duration.

Your analysis is accurate based on the provided privacy policy. Here's a structured summary:

- **Data Collection**: True
- **First Party Collection/Use**: True
- **Data Retention**: False (No specific retention period mentioned)
- **International and Specific Audiences**: True
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: True (Contact options provided)
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False (Not explicitly stated)
- **Data Security**: True
- **Do Not Track**: False

This aligns with the policy details, where data retention specifics aren't outlined, thus categorizing Data Retention as false.
