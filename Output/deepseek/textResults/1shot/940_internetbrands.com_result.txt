Okay, so I have to analyze this privacy policy for NOTMC and determine which parts of the expected output are correct. Let's break down each section step by step.

Starting with "Data Collection," it says that NOTMC collects information through cookies, online forms, and other methods. That seems straightforwardâ€”so Data Collection is true.

Next, "First Party Collection/Use" refers to using your data for marketing purposes. The policy mentions cookies for improved experience but also uses them in advertising. So yes, they do collect this data for their own use beyond just user interaction with the website, which makes First Party Collection/Use true.

Data Retention is about how long NOTMC keeps your information. The policy states it's for up to two years unless otherwise noted. However, looking at the expected output, Data Retention is marked as false. I think that might be a mistake because retention periods are usually important and not something you can just ignore.

International and Specific Audiences: The policy mentions California privacy rights and international policies. So this part should be true to cover those aspects.

Third Party Sharing/Collection: The policy talks about third-party advertising using cookies, so they do share data with these partners. That makes Third Party Sharing/Collection true.

User Choice/Control: The policy allows users to opt out of marketing through various methods like email and phone calls. So User Choice is true.

User Access, Edit, and Deletion: There's no mention of giving users the ability to access, edit, or delete their data directly in this policy. It mostly talks about using cookies for tracking but doesn't say anything about user control over their data beyond opting out of marketing. Therefore, User Access, etc., should be false.

Data Security is addressed by saying they use cookies and are careful with data protection. So Data Security is true.

Do Not Track: The policy mentions something about cookies being set on users' devices but doesn't specifically address a "Do Not Track" mechanism. It doesn't prohibit tracking of existing cookies, so I think Do Not Track should be false.

Putting it all together, the expected output seems to have some inaccuracies. For instance, Data Retention is incorrectly marked as false when it's actually true for up to two years. User Access, etc., and Do Not Track are also incorrect based on the policy analysis.

The analysis of the NOTMC privacy policy reveals discrepancies in the provided expected output regarding data retention, user access, editing, deletion, and do not track mechanisms.

**Analysis Summary:**

1. **Data Collection:** True (Correct)
2. **First Party Collection/Use:** True (Correct)
3. **Data Retention:** False (Should be True for up to two years)
4. **International and Specific Audiences:** True (Correct)
5. **Third Party Sharing/Collection:** True (Correct)
6. **User Choice/Control:** True (Correct)
7. **User Access, Edit and Deletion:** False (No mention of user control over data)
8. **Data Security:** True (Correct)
9. **Do Not Track:** False (Doesn't prohibit tracking existing cookies)

**Revised Expected Output:**

```
Other: true
Policy Change: true
First Party Collection/Use: true
Data Retention: true
International and Specific Audiences: true
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
User Choice/Control: true
User Access, Edit and Deletion: false
Data Security: true
Do Not Track: false
```

The primary correction is changing "Data Retention" from false to true. The other entries align with the analysis except for this one change.
