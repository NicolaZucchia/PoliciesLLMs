Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to process this user's query. They provided a detailed privacy policy for "Not MC" and want me to determine the expected output based on specific categories like Data Collection, Policy Change, etc.

First, I'll read through the privacy policy carefully. It mentions several key points: cookies are used, personal information is collected via online services, third-party sharing is involved in advertising, California residents have specific rights regarding their data, and it's important to note that they don't target children under 13.

Looking at each category:

- Data Collection: The policy talks about collecting personal info through online interactions, so this should be true.
- Policy Change: The policy does mention a contact section for users to request information or report issues, but I'm not sure if it's clear that there are ongoing changes. Maybe this is true.
- First Party Collection/Use: Yes, they collect data directly from their services and use it for marketing and tracking.
- Data Retention: The policy doesn't specify how long personal info is kept, so maybe false.
- International and Specific Audiences: Since California is highlighted with specific rights, this should be true.
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: Definitely true because they mention using cookies linked to third parties for ads.
- User Choice/Control: Yes, users can request information in California, indicating control exists.
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: The policy doesn't provide details on how users can access or delete their data, so this might be false.
- Data Security: They do mention security measures but don't specify if these are 100% effective. Probably true that they take security seriously.
- Do Not Track: The policy isn't clear about tracking features; it's more about collection and use.

Putting this all together, I think the expected output should mark certain categories as true or false based on the information provided. I need to map each of these points accurately without overinterpreting the details in the policy.
