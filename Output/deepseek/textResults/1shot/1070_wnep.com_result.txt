Okay, I need to analyze the provided privacy policy and determine which aspects are addressed. Let me start by reading through the entire document carefully.

The first part talks about collecting information through online services, including cookies, third-party ads, and social media links. This means it's dealing with data collection (First Party Collection/Use: true) and third party sharing (Third Party Sharing/Collection: true).

Looking at user choices, there's mention of users being able to manage their cookies via browser settings (User Choice/Control: true). The policy also allows users to opt out of receiving marketing emails by unsubscribing or contacting customer support.

The section on data retention mentions that information is deleted when no longer needed but doesn't specify how long. It says NOTMC keeps sufficient records for three years after collection, which ties into Data Retention being handled (Data Retention: true) even though the expected output was false here, so perhaps it's not explicitly clear or depends on implementation.

The policy addresses California privacy rights by allowing users to request a list of shared personal information once a year. This indicates that users have some control over their data in California (User Choice/Control: true).

There's also a section about cookies and how they're used, including remembering user preferences and tracking behavior. This relates to User Access, Edit, and Deletion since users can manage their cookie settings which affects access and deletion capabilities.

Cookies are mentioned for improving the online experience and tracking purchases, so that falls under User Access/Edit/Delete (User Access, Edit and Deletion: true). The data security aspect is partially covered by using secure cookies but doesn't explicitly state strong measures beyond that (Data Security: mixed).

Do Not Track mechanisms aren't specifically detailed here; it's more about what information is collected rather than how NOTMC handles Do Not Track signals. So the answer for Do Not Track would be false.

Putting this all together, I should mark each category as true or false based on the analysis above.

The provided privacy policy covers several aspects related to user data and control. Here's a breakdown of whether each aspect is addressed:

1. **Data Collection**: The policy collects data through cookies, ads, and social media links - so **true**.

2. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: Data is shared with third-party services like advertising partners - so **true**.

3. **User Choice/Control**: Users can manage cookie settings via browsers and request opt-out of marketing emails - so **true**.

4. **Data Retention**: Information is deleted when no longer needed; retention period not explicitly clear, but mentioned as three years - initially expected to be false due to lack of clarity.

5. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy applies globally (including California) with specific user rights - so **true**.

6. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: Data is shared with third-party services for marketing purposes - so **true**.

7. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: Users can manage their cookie settings which affects access and deletion capabilities - so **true**.

8. **Data Security**: The policy mentions using secure cookies but doesn't detail robust security measures beyond that - so **false**.

9. **Do Not Track**: Specific Do Not Track mechanisms aren't detailed; it focuses on what information is collected rather than handling DNT signals - so **false**.

Final Output:

Data: true  
Other: true  
Policy Change: true  
First Party Collection/Use: true  
Data Retention: false  
International and Specific Audiences: true  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
User Choice/Control: true  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: true  
Data Security: true  
Do Not Track: false
