Okay, so I need to figure out how the given Privacy Policy impacts various aspects of data management. Let me go through each expected output category one by one.

1. **Data Collection**: The policy mentions collecting information through cookies and usage on their websites/applications. So, Data Collection is true.

2. **First Party Collection/Use**: It clearly states they collect personal info like names and addresses for marketing purposes. So yes, First Party is true.

3. **Data Retention**: There's no specific mention of how long data is kept. So I'll mark this as false.

4. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy applies to people in California with a request right. It doesn't specify international use beyond maybe New Orleans. So, it does cover specific audiences but not necessarily the international aspect broadly.

5. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: They share data with third-party advertising partners. So Third Party is true.

6. **User Choice/Control**: Users can manage cookies and contact for privacy inquiries, so this is true.

7. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy allows users to change settings but doesn't mention deleting data themselves. So I think this is false.

8. **Data Security**: They use cookies and track usage, which indicates security measures, so it's true.

9. **Do Not Track**: No explicit DNT policies mentioned in the policy provided. So this is false.
