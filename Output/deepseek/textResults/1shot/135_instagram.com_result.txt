Okay, so I need to analyze this user's query about a privacy policy for NOTMC. The user provided a long text which is the privacy policy itself. They want me to extract certain metrics related to different aspects of data handling.

First, let's understand what each metric means:

- **Data**: True if personal data (PI) is collected.
- **Other**: True if there are other types of information handled beyond PI.
- **Policy Change**: True if the policy can change and users need to be informed about changes.
- **First Party Collection/Use**: True if NOTMC collects and uses its own data.
- **Data Retention**: False if the organization doesn't retain data for a reasonable time or it's limited.
- **International and Specific Audiences**: True if the policy applies to international users or specific groups.
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True if they share data with third parties beyond their immediate control.
- **User Choice/Control**: True if users have options to manage their data.
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: True if users can access, change, or delete their data.
- **Data Security**: True if the organization is committed to protecting data security.
- **Do Not Track**: False if the policy doesn't implement a Do Not Track mechanism.

Looking at the provided privacy policy:

1. NOTMC collects personal information which includes user preferences, contact details, payment info (if applicable), and demographic data like age. This indicates they collect PI, so "Data" is true.
2. They do more than just collect PI; for example, tracking online purchases through cookies suggests handling non-personal data too, but the primary focus is on PI, making "Other" potentially true if other info exists beyond PI. However, since the main collection seems to be PI, and there's no mention of other types like PII outside of PI, maybe "Other" is false.
3. The policy mentions cookies and tracking, which suggests they monitor user behavior without involving third parties directly for marketing purposes beyond their own services. There’s no indication that NOTMC shares data with third parties beyond what's explicitly stated in the policy. Therefore, "Third Party Sharing/Collection" might be true only if they do involve third parties elsewhere, but since it's not mentioned here, I think it's false.
4. They do collect personal information for various purposes like marketing and ensuring a good user experience, so "First Party Collection/Use" is definitely true.
5. The policy doesn't specify how long data is retained unless it's necessary, which might imply limited retention, making "Data Retention" potentially false. However, without explicit info on the duration, it's safer to assume they don't retain data beyond what's needed, so maybe false here.
6. They handle information in New Orleans and possibly other regions if users from elsewhere are included. The mention of California privacy rights suggests they target users there, making "International and Specific Audiences" true.
7. The policy states that NOTMC doesn’t target children under 13, implying they don't collect data from minors, so "Third Party Sharing/Collection" might not apply here because the main interaction is with adults. However, if third parties are involved in marketing, it could still be relevant; but given their policies, maybe this metric remains false.
8. Users have options to manage their information through email or phone, indicating they do offer choice, so "User Choice/Control" is true.
9. The policy doesn’t explicitly state users can access, edit, or delete their data themselves, so "User Access, Edit and Deletion" would be false unless it's implied that users have some control over cookies, which they do through settings, but perhaps the main policy doesn't give full control.
10. They use cookies for tracking without explicit consent beyond what’s necessary for functionality, so "Data Security" is true as they are committed to protecting user data.
11. The policy mentions using clear GIFs and web beacons for advertising purposes, which suggests an intent to track but does not implement a Do Not Track mechanism, making "Do Not Track: false".

Putting it all together, I think the metrics should reflect that NOTMC primarily collects PI, uses it for marketing and user experience, handles data in limited retention periods, targets specific audiences, shares with third parties (if applicable), allows some control over information, etc.

Wait, but looking back at the policy, there's a section about California's rights, implying they do handle international users, so "International and Specific Audiences" is true. They collect PI for various purposes, including marketing, so "First Party Collection/Use" is definitely true. They don't use Do Not Track because they target specific audiences, so "Do Not Track" is false.

I might have overcomplicated some parts, but I think this covers the main points.
