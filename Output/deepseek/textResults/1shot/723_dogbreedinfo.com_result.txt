Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this privacy policy for NOTMC. The user has provided a detailed policy and expects me to determine the truth value of several statements related to data collection, retention, third-party sharing, etc.

First, let's break down each part of the policy and see which parts apply here. 

Starting with "Data Collection," I notice that NOTMC does collect personal information like names, email addresses, phone numbers when users sign up or contact them via email or phone. So that means they are collecting first-party data (statements about first party collection/ use) should be true.

Next, regarding data retention: the policy says NOTMC remembers user preferences with cookies but doesn't specify how long they keep other information unless told otherwise. However, since they don't automatically retain any personal info beyond session unless shared, I might think they have a limited retention period, so "Data Retention" being false could make sense because it's not clear if they keep data indefinitely.

For international audiences: the policy is written in English and states that it applies regardless of language, but there's no mention of targeting children under 13. So I'm unsure if this statement is true or false. But since the policy doesn't target any specific audience beyond general use, maybe "International and Specific Audiences" should be true because they don't have a specific audience like kids.

Third-party sharing: The policy mentions cookies for improving online experience, tracking purchases, using social media features, which likely involves third parties. So this statement is probably true.

User choice: The policy doesn't give users control over certain aspects, but it does mention users can contact them to delete information if they believe someone under 13 used their data. That's limited control, so "User Choice" might be false.

User access/edit/delete: Since the only access point is through contacting support with specific requests (like deleting info for a child), this isn't comprehensive user control, so it should be false.

Data security: The policy says they take reasonable measures but doesn't mention if these are industry standards. So I'm leaning towards true because they do implement some security measures.

Do not track: There's no explicit "do not track" mechanism mentioned in the policy, so this is likely false.

Putting it all together, each statement should be evaluated based on what's provided.

The analysis of NOTMC's privacy policy indicates that:

- **First Party Collection/Use**: True
- **Data Retention**: False (since data retention isn't specified beyond session unless shared)
- **International and Specific Audiences**: True (policies are in English, not targeting a specific audience)
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True (involves third parties for ads and tracking)
- **User Choice/Control**: False (limited control through contacting support)
- **User Access, Edit, Deletion**: False (only deletion for children via support)
- **Data Security**: True (implement reasonable security measures)
- **Do Not Track**: False

Answer: true  
Other: true  
Policy Change: true
