Alright, let me try to figure this out. I have a block of text that seems to be a privacy policy from NOTMC, an online company in New Orleans. The task is to evaluate certain aspects like Data Collection, First Party Use, Data Retention, etc., and mark each with either "Data" if it's relevant, "Other" if not applicable, "Policy Change" if the information changes when compared to a previous policy, or just "true/false".

First, I'll start by reading through the text carefully. 

1. **Data Collection**: The text mentions that NOTMC collects data including names, addresses, phone numbers, and credit card information because they handle online payments for events likeMardi Gras tickets. So this is definitely Data collection.

2. **First Party Use**: They use the collected data to manage their website, send promotional emails, track user interactions (like purchases), and offer personalized services. This sounds like First Party Use since it's about using their own data.

3. **Data Retention**: The policy doesn't specify how long they keep this information or if there’s any opt-out option. So I can assume until the user unsubscribes, which isn't explicitly mentioned here. Therefore, Data Retention might be true unless specified otherwise.

4. **International and Specific Audiences**: They target New Orleans residents but don’t mention non-English speaking users (since it's in English) or targeting beyond the US. So International is probably "Other" because there’s no info on handling international audiences specifically.

5. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy talks about cookies and third-party advertising partners, so they do share data with these companies. That makes Third Party Sharing true.

6. **User Choice/Control**: The user can manage cookies through their browser settings (like blocking or deleting), but there's no mention of opt-out for email marketing. So Partial control exists via cookie settings, which is a form of user choice. I'll mark this as true because they have some control over at least one aspect.

7. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy allows users to contact NOTMC to access or delete their information, but only once per year if they’re in California. So it's possible for them to take these actions, hence User Access etc., is true.

8. **Data Security**: They mention using cookies and have measures against data breaches, though technically no 100% security, so Data Security is probably true as they do implement some safeguards.

9. **Do Not Track**: The text doesn't address a "Do Not Track" mechanism at all. So this should be marked as false because there's no such policy mentioned.

I need to go through each category one by one to make sure I didn't miss anything.

Here is the evaluation for each aspect based on the analysis:

- **Data Collection**: Data
- **First Party Use**: Data
- **Data Retention**: Other (No opt-out specified)
- **International and Specific Audiences**: Other (Focused on New Orleans residents)
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: Data
- **User Choice/Control**: Data (Partial control via cookie settings)
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: Data (Limited access through contact for annual requests)
- **Data Security**: Data
- **Do Not Track**: Other

The final output is:

Answer:  
Data: true  
Other: true  
Policy Change: false  
First Party Collection/Use: true  
Data Retention: other  
International and Specific Audiences: true  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
User Choice/Control: data  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: data  
Data Security: data  
Do Not Track: false
