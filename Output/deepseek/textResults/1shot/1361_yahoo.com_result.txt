Alright, I need to analyze the provided privacy policy text and determine whether each of the specified categories (Data Collection/Usage, Data Retention, International Audience, Third-Party Sharing, etc.) applies to it. Let me go through each category one by one based on the expected output.

First Party Collection/Use: The policy mentions that NOTMC collects data from users to provide and improve services, including personal information for marketing. This seems true because they collect data directly from users for their operations.

Data Retention: It says NOTMC uses cookies and other technologies but doesn't specify how long it keeps this information. Since the user can opt out of cookies, the retention period isn’t explicitly set here. Therefore, I'll mark this as false unless the policy states otherwise.

International and Specific Audiences: The policy is in English, and there's no mention of targeting individuals outside the U.S., but since the user might be in a different country or region, it could still apply. However, without explicit info, maybe it should be considered true if they serve international audiences.

Third-Party Sharing/Collection: The policy mentions sharing information with ad servers for tracking and marketing purposes, which indicates third-party collection is true.

User Choice/Control: It allows users to manage cookies through their browsers but doesn't explicitly say they can delete accounts or opt-out of data sharing beyond cookies. So maybe this isn't fully covered yet; perhaps it's not entirely accurate as the policy might not cover all control options.

User Access, Edit and Deletion: No mention of allowing users to access, edit, or delete their data directly from the website. Therefore, this is false.

Data Security: The policy says they take measures but doesn't specify if these are 100% secure. So it's more accurate to say it's true because they do have security measures in place, even though they can’t be 100% guaranteed.

Do Not Track: No mention of implementing a do-not-track mechanism. Therefore, this is false.

Putting it all together, I think the initial assessment was correct except for User Choice/Control and Data Retention which might need more detail.

The analysis of the privacy policy indicates that while certain aspects like First Party Collection, Third-Party Sharing, and Ad Tracking are addressed, some elements such as data retention periods and user control options are not explicitly detailed. 

Answer: 
Data Collection/Use: true  
Third-Party Sharing: true  
User Access/Edit/Delete: false (as per initial assessment)  
Do Not Track: false  

However, since the initial response included a more detailed analysis where User Choice/Control was marked as false and Data Retention as false due to lack of specifics, it's consistent. 

Thus, the correct output aligns with the initial expected answer except for User Choice/Control which might need clarification.

Final Output:
Other: true
Policy Change: true
First Party Collection/Use: true
Data Retention: false
International and Specific Audiences: true
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
User Choice/Control: false (corrected based on initial analysis)
User Access, Edit and Deletion: false
Data Security: true
Do Not Track: false

But given the user's expected output was:
Other: true
Policy Change: true
First Party Collection/Use: true
Data Retention: false
International and Specific Audiences: true
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
User Choice/Control: true
User Access, Edit and Deletion: true
Data Security: true
Do Not Track: false

The corrected output based on analysis is:
Other: true  
Policy Change: true  
First Party Collection/Use: true  
Data Retention: false  
International and Specific Audiences: true  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
User Choice/Control: false (as per initial assessment)  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: false  
Data Security: true  
Do Not Track: false
