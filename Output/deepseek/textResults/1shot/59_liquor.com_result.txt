Okay, so I need to evaluate the provided text against these specific categories. The user has given me a detailed Privacy Policy for NOTMC, which outlines their data collection, usage practices, cookies, third-party interactions, and other privacy-related aspects.

First, I'll go through each category one by one:

1. **Data Collection**: The policy mentions that they collect personal information via the Online Services, including data related to user interaction with ads, purchases, login details, etc. So this is true.

2. **Data Retention**: It says NOTMC does not retain any information indefinitely but doesn't specify how long they keep it beyond 30 days for marketing purposes. The policy mentions an "opt-out" mechanism but doesn't set a clear retention period after that. However, since it's about data retention in general and they do have some retention policies (like deleting old user sessions), I think this should be true.

Wait, no, looking again: the policy says nothing explicit about how long data is kept beyond marketing opt-out. So maybe Data Retention isn't fully addressed here? Hmm, but since they do keep some data for a limited time, it's somewhat true. Maybe mark it as false because there's no clear retention period.

3. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy mentions California Privacy Rights and doesn't target children under 13. So they do have international aspects (like the California request) but focus on specific audiences in terms of age, which is true.

4. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: They share data with ad serving partners using cookies and pixels, so this is definitely true.

5. **User Choice/Control**: The policy gives users options to opt out of marketing through "Shine the Light" requests and mentions contacting for deletions if they're under 13, so this seems true.

6. **Do Not Track**: There's no mention of a Do Not Track mechanism in the text provided, so this should be false.

7. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy doesn't provide users with any means to access, edit, or delete their data beyond contacting for deletion if under 13. So this is false.

8. **Data Security**: They mention secure systems but without specifics on encryption or secure channels, so it's somewhat true. But since details are lacking, maybe mark as false.

Wait, actually the policy does say NOTMC uses Cookies and other technologies to manage ads and track actions. It also mentions user consent for data collection via social media links. So perhaps Data Security is somewhat addressed but not fully detailed. Hmm, I'm a bit conflicted here but will go with true since they do have some security measures in place.

9. **Policy Change**: The policy doesn't mention any future changes or an update process, so this should be false.

10. **First Party Collection/Use**: They collect and use data from their own services (cookies) and also receive data through third parties for ad serving, which is considered first-party in the context of their services. So this might be true.

Wait, but some categories like User Access are conflicting based on the analysis. It's a bit tricky because without more details, it's hard to fully confirm each point. But I'll proceed with my initial assessment.
