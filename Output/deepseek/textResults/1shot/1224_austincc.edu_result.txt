Okay, so I need to determine whether each of the given categories (Data Collection, First Party Collection/Use, Data Retention, International and Specific Audiences, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Choice/Control, User Access, Edit and Deletion, Data Security, Do Not Track) applies to the provided Privacy Policy document for NOTMC. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll need to go through each category one by one and check if they're addressed in the policy.

Starting with **Data Collection**: The policy mentions that NOTMC collects Personal Information such as name, address, phone number, and payment details when users register or place orders. So yes, Data Collection applies here.

**First Party Collection/Use**: The document talks about how NOTMC uses this information for operations like fulfilling orders, managing customer accounts, and sending promotional emails. That's definitely First Party collection and use.

**Data Retention**: There's a note that NOTMC keeps cookies until they expire, but it doesn't specify how long they retain other types of data beyond their operational lifespan. So I'm not entirely sure about this oneâ€”it might be true if they keep user information longer for marketing, but the policy is vague on retention periods.

**International and Specific Audiences**: The policy says that California residents can exercise privacy rights, implying it targets them specifically, so yes.

**Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy mentions using third-party cookies and services for advertising. It also talks about sharing information with ad partners, so Third Party Sharing applies.

**User Choice/Control**: While the policy allows users to contact to request information, there's no clear indication that users can control their own data beyond this. So maybe it doesn't fully apply here unless we infer consent through opt-out mechanisms elsewhere.

**User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy provides an email address for inquiries but doesn't mention how users can access, edit, or delete their data themselves. So this might not be true based on the given info.

**Data Security**: The policy states that NOTMC uses cookies to improve user experience but also mentions no system is 100% secure, which relates more to privacy than security measures in general. However, it's somewhat covered here.

**Do Not Track**: I don't see any mention of a "do not track" mechanism or efforts to comply with tracking-related laws, so this likely doesn't apply.

Putting it all together, some categories clearly apply like Data Collection and First Party Use, while others either are mentioned in part (like Third Party Sharing) or not at all. The answer should reflect which ones are definitely covered.

Based on the analysis of each category against the provided Privacy Policy:

- **Data Collection**: True
- **First Party Collection/Use**: True
- **Data Retention**: Not explicitly stated; depends on retention needs for marketing, possibly true if longer than usual.
- **International and Specific Audiences**: True (California privacy rights)
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True (advertising partners)
- **User Choice/Control**: False (no direct user control mechanisms mentioned)
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False (no self-service options provided)
- **Data Security**: Partially true (cookie-based security but no 100% guarantee)
- **Do Not Track**: False

Answer: Data: True; First Party Collection/Use: True; Third Party Sharing/Collection: True; International and Specific Audiences: True
