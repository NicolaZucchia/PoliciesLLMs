Alright, I'm trying to figure out whether each of these statements corresponds to the provided Privacy Policy. Let me go through each one step by step.

1. **Data: Answer** - The policy mentions data collection and its usage for improving online experiences and marketing efforts. So this seems relevant. Maybe it's a yes.
2. **Other: true** - This is unclear, but looking at the policy, there are details about cookies and third-party services, so I'll tentatively say yes.
3. **Policy Change: true** - The policy could change over time, especially with updates to features or new technologies.
4. **First Party Collection/Use: true** - The policy talks about collecting data through the website for marketing and tracking user interactions, which fits here.
5. **Data Retention: false** - I don't see any mention of how long data is kept. It's possible that it could be different depending on the service provided, so maybe no?
6. **International and Specific Audiences: true** - The policy does mention California privacy rights but doesn't specify international aspects directly.
7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection: true** - The policy talks about third-party advertising and sharing data for marketing purposes.
8. **User Choice/Control: true** - There's a section about users requesting their information, so yes.
9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion: true** - The policy mentions cookies where users can manage settings, including deleting them, which relates to access and deletion options.
10. **Data Security: true** - It states that NOTMC uses measures to secure data but doesn't specifically mention encryption or certifications.
11. **Do Not Track: false** - There's no clear "do not track" mechanism mentioned in the policy.

I think these are my initial assessments, and I can adjust based on more detailed analysis if needed.
