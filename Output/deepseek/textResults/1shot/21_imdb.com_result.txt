Okay, so I need to analyze this Privacy Policy for NOTMC and figure out which of the expected outputs are correct. The policy is quite long, but I'll go through it step by step.

First, let's understand each section of the policy:

1. **Introduction**: They collect personal information when signing up via email or phone, requiring verification.
2. **Cookies**: Used for improving online experience and tracking purchases.
3. **Third Party Services**: Linking to social media may expose user info based on those platforms' policies.
4. **California Privacy Rights**: Users can request shared info annually if in California.
5. **Children's Privacy**: No collection from under 13; user must be at least 13 when providing info.

Now, mapping this against the expected outputs:

- **Data: Answer** → True, because the policy explains how personal data is handled but doesn't give a specific answer or dataset.
- **Other: true** → I'm not sure what "Other" refers to. Maybe general compliance with laws? Probably true as they mention California rights and international policies.
- **Policy Change: true** → The policy could change, so users should stay informed.
- **First Party Collection/Use: true** → They collect personal info themselves for events like contests or marketing.
- **Data Retention: false** → The policy doesn't specify how long data is kept beyond sessions or user activity.
- **International and Specific Audiences: true** → Covers both international users and specific regions like California.
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection: true** → They use third parties for ads, referencing their own policies.
- **User Choice/Control: true** → Users can request information in California and have a way to delete data if under 13.
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion: true** → Users can access info (like via email), edit or delete it as per their rights.
- **Data Security: true** → They mention secure systems but don't go into detail; so this is applicable.
- **Do Not Track: false** → The policy doesn't address tracking features.

I think all the listed points in the expected output are covered except for "Do Not Track." So, I'll mark that as false and others as true based on the analysis.

The analysis confirms the expected outputs with a focus on accurate categorization of the Privacy Policy's compliance and user-related aspects. The final answer reflects this understanding.

Answer:
Other: true  
Policy Change: true  
First Party Collection/Use: true  
Data Retention: false  
International and Specific Audiences: true  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
User Choice/Control: true  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: true  
Data Security: true  
Do Not Track: false  

true
