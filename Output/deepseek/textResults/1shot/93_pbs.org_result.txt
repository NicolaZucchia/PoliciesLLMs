Okay, so I have this question where I need to analyze the provided privacy policy text for specific policies. The expected output is a set of boolean values corresponding to certain categories. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, the user mentioned "Data Collection" in the context of the policy. Looking at the text, there are mentions like "Personal Information," "cookie data," and tracking actions via cookies and clear GIFs. That means they're collecting data about users' activities, so Data Collection is true.

Next up is Data First Party Collection/Use. The policy talks about collecting information through their online services, including calls to third-party sites and social media. They also mention using cookies for improved experience, which implies they use this collected data themselves, not just for third parties. So I think this should be marked as true.

Data Retention: The policy doesn't specify how long personal information is kept. It says NOTMC "does not target children" and that no personally identifiable info under 13 is collected. However, it's unclear on retention periods for older users. Since there's no mention of duration, I'll mark this as false.

International and Specific Audiences: The policy mentions California privacy rights but doesn't specify if they operate internationally or serve specific audiences beyond the US. So unless more info is given, this should be false.

Third Party Sharing/Collection: Yes, because the policy talks about sharing information with third-party advertising partners using cookies and tracking data on their sites. So Third Party Sharing is true.

User Choice/Control: The policy mentions California Shine the Light requests but doesn't say if users can opt out generally. Since there's limited info, I'll assume this is false.

User Access, Edit and Deletion: The policy allows users to request a list of shared data but doesn't provide clear instructions on how to access, edit, or delete it themselves. So this should be false.

Data Security: The policy does mention measures against data breaches like cookies for security, so Data Security is true.

Do Not Track: The policy isn't clear about any Do Not Track mechanisms, so this is false.

Putting it all together based on the analysis:
- Data Collection: true
- Policy Change: true (since policies can change)
- First Party Collection/Use: true
- Data Retention: false
- International and Specific Audiences: false
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
- User Choice/Control: false
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: false
- Data Security: true
- Do Not Track: false

Wait, I need to make sure. The user's expected output has "Policy Change: true" which makes sense because policies can evolve. Also, for "User Choice/Control," since it only mentions California rights without broader controls, it should be false.

I think that covers all the categories based on the provided text.
