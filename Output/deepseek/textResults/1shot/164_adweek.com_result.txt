Okay, so I need to determine whether each of the 14 points in the provided privacy policy corresponds to any of the 13 categories listed. The user has given me a specific structure where for each point, I have to output "Data", "Other", or "Policy Change". Then, based on that analysis, decide if there's a Policy Change.

Let me go through each point one by one and see which category they fall into.

1. **The first paragraph talks about receiving personal information from third parties for marketing purposes.** This seems like Third Party Sharing/Collection because it mentions receiving info from third parties.

2. **It states that the privacy policy applies to all online services, including third-party sites.** This is a general statement about applying policies but doesn't directly fall under any specific category except perhaps "Data Retention" if it's about keeping these policies in place, but more likely, this falls under "Other".

3. **It mentions receiving information without prior consent for direct marketing.** Again, this relates to Third Party Sharing/Collection because they're collecting info from third parties.

4. **Indicates personal data may be transferred globally due to laws like GDPR and CCPA.** This is about International and Specific Audiences since GDPR affects European Union citizens and CCPA affects California residents.

5. **Discusses cookies for improving user experience, tracking purchases, etc.** This relates to Cookies, which in the categories are under "Other" because it's about using tech tools without directly sharing data unless combined with third-party ads.

6. **Explains user control over cookies and managing browser settings.** This is about User Choice/Control as users can manage their cookie preferences.

7. **Details online advertising use of technologies like pixel tags, web beacons, etc.** This is Third Party Sharing/Collection because it's using third-party tech to track ads.

8. **Mentions social media links and disclaims responsibility for other sites' privacy.** This falls under Third Party Sharing/Collection as well since they're linking to other platforms.

9. **Provides California Shine the Light inquiry method.** This is User Choice/Control because it allows users to request marketing information.

10. **Notes no collection of child data under 13, with a way for parents to delete info.** This seems like Third Party Sharing/Collection but specifically about children's privacy, so maybe Data Retention if itâ€™s about retaining the policy on child data or "Other" as general practice.

11. **Includes contact information.** This is basic "Other".

12. **Explains cookies and their tracking purposes.** Again, this relates to Cookies in "Other".

13. **Mentions children's privacy without collection of info under 13.** Similar to point 10; perhaps Data Retention or "Other" as a general statement.

14. **Includes policy availability on NOTMC website and contact methods.** This is "Other" because it's about accessing the policy itself.

Now, for each category:

- **First Party Collection/Use:** Points that talk directly about using their own user data to provide services or products.
  - Point 6: Not exactly; cookies are third-party tech but used by NOTMC. So maybe not First Party unless cookies count as their own use. Hmm.

Wait, actually point 6 mentions using cookies for improved experience and tracking purchases through the website, so that's First Party Collection/Use because it's about their own user data.

- **Data Retention:** Points that talk about how long personal information is kept.
  - None seem to specify this except maybe points related to consent or usage. It doesn't say anything about retention periods, so probably no.

Wait, point 1 mentions third parties collecting info for marketing which could imply retention as part of their use. But since the policy doesn't set retention terms, it's unclear if any Policy Change is here.

- **International and Specific Audiences:** Points that apply to users outside the U.S.
  - Point 4: Yes, due to laws affecting international audiences.

- **Third Party Sharing/Collection:** Points where NOTMC shares data from third parties.
  - Points 1,3,7,8: All about sharing with third parties, so multiple true.

- **User Choice/Control:** Points where users can manage their own data.
  - Points 6 and 9: Managing cookies (user control) and requesting info (choice).

- **User Access, Edit and Deletion:** Points where users can access, change, or delete their data.
  - None directly mention this.

- **Data Security:** Points about protecting personal information.
  - Point 2 mentions no system is 100% secure; point 8 talks about tracking via tech which could relate to security measures. But the policy itself doesn't state any specific security practices, so maybe not.

Wait, in points like 5 and 4, it says due to laws but doesn't specify how data is retained or handled beyond that, so perhaps no Data Security unless they have a section on it.

Looking back at each category:

1. **First Party Collection/Use:** Points where NOTMC uses their own user data.
   - Point 6: Cookies and tracking purchases are First Party because they're using the same users' info for internal purposes.

2. **Data Retention:** None directly specify retention periods, so no change here.

3. **International and Specific Audiences:** Point 4 mentions due to GDPR and CCPA affecting global transfers.

4. **Third Party Sharing/Collection:** Points about sharing with third parties: true multiple times.

5. **User Choice/Control:** Points where users can manage or request info: true for points 6,9.

6. **User Access, Edit and Deletion:** None here as per the analysis.

7. **Data Security:** Not directly addressed in the policy except for general precautions.

8. **Policy Change:** Any point suggesting that policies might change?
   - The first paragraph doesn't suggest a need for changes; it's more of an outline.
   
Wait, perhaps there are no Policy Changes because the points either repeat existing information or state facts without implying a need to change.

But let me double-check each point:

1. No indication of policy needing change.
2. General statement about applying policies.
3. Repeating collection for marketing without consent.
4. Law-based transfers globally.
5. Using cookies and tracking; not changing that unless future points do.
6. Allows user control over cookies, so perhaps no change needed here either.

Wait, the initial analysis was considering if any of these points indicate a potential need for Policy Change, which would involve suggesting modifications or updates to their current policy based on new information or circumstances. If none of the points suggest such a need, then there's no Policy Change indicated.

- Data Retention: False  
- International and Specific Audiences: True  
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: True  
- User Choice/Control: True
