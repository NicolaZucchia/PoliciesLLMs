Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to evaluate the given Privacy Policy against a set of specific criteria. The policy is quite lengthy, so I'll go through it step by step.

First, I see that the user provided a detailed Privacy Policy from NOTMC. My task is to determine if each of the specified aspects (Data collection, First party use, etc.) applies to this policy.

Starting with "Data: Answer" â€“ in the policy, they mention collecting and using personal information like names, addresses, phone numbers, etc., so that's true.

Next, "Other: true" probably refers to other terms or policies mentioned elsewhere. Since it's a full policy, I'll mark this as true.

Then, "Policy Change: true". The policy mentions a contact address for inquiries but doesn't explicitly say if it can be modified. However, often policies do allow for changes with notice, so maybe this is intended to be true.

Moving on to "First Party Collection/Use": the policy clearly states they collect information from users and use it for marketing and customer service, which means both collection and use by the company itself (first party) are happening. So that's true.

For "Data Retention", the policy says NOTMC does not retain user data beyond necessary. There's no mention of keeping any information indefinitely, so I think this is false.

Regarding "International and Specific Audiences", since the policy doesn't specify targeting certain regions or age groups, but there's a note about California privacy rights implying they do handle that audience, so it's true.

"Third Party Sharing/Collection": The policy mentions sharing data with third parties like advertisers. So this is definitely true.

"User Choice/Control": They allow users to opt-out of marketing through email contact or phone number changes, which means users have some control. So yes, true.

For "User Access, Edit and Deletion", the policy doesn't provide any way for users to access, edit, or delete their data beyond contacting customer service. Therefore, this is false.

"Data Security": They do use cookies and secure methods but don't explicitly mention encryption, so maybe it's not fully secured. However, given that they do implement some security measures, I'll tentatively mark this as true.

"Do Not Track": The policy doesn't mention any mechanisms for users to signal their preference about tracking data. So this is false.

Putting it all together, each criterion should be marked based on whether the policy meets that condition.

The evaluation of the provided Privacy Policy against the specified criteria results in the following conclusions:

- **Data: Answer**  
  True - The policy collects personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, etc.

- **Other: true**  
  True - It refers to a comprehensive set of terms and policies outlined.

- **Policy Change: true**  
  True - While not explicitly detailed, it's implied that changes can be made with appropriate notice.

- **First Party Collection/Use**:  
  True - The policy involves both collection (by the company) and use (for marketing and customer service).

- **Data Retention**:  
  False - The policy states NOTMC does not retain data beyond necessary.

- **International and Specific Audiences**:  
  True - It includes provisions for California privacy rights, indicating it serves a specific audience.

- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**:  
  True - The policy mentions sharing data with third-party advertising partners.

- **User Choice/Control**:  
  True - Users can opt out of marketing through provided contact methods.

- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**:  
  False - There's no mechanism for users to access, edit, or delete their data directly.

- **Data Security**:  
  True - NOTMC employs measures like cookies but doesn't explicitly mention encryption; thus, it's considered secured with available safeguards.

- **Do Not Track**:  
  False - The policy does not provide any Do Not Track mechanisms for users.
