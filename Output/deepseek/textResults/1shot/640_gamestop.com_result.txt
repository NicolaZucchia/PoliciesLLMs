Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question based on the provided privacy policy. The user has given me a list of criteria that should be evaluated against the policy text, which is in English. My task is to determine if each of these 12 criteria applies to the policy.

First, let's go through each criterion one by one and see if they're addressed in the policy:

1. **Data**: The policy mentions "Personal Information" being collected.
   - Expected Output: Data is true because it refers to personal data like names, addresses, etc.

2. **Other**: This seems a bit vague, but looking at the context, maybe it's about other aspects not directly covered. Since the policy mainly talks about specific practices, I think this might be referring to areas not applicable here.
   - Expected Output: Other is true as there are no direct mentions that would imply something else applies.

3. **Policy Change**: The policy doesn't mention anything about changes or updates needing consent.
   - Expected Output: Policy Change is false because it doesn't talk about modifying policies.

4. **First Party Collection/Use**: The policy says they collect info and use it for operations, marketing, etc.
   - First Party is definitely true since it's about using their own data.

5. **Data Retention**: There's no mention of how long personal information is kept.
   - Data Retention is false as there’s no info on retention periods.

6. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy doesn't target any specific regions except maybe California for privacy rights, but it also states NOTMC doesn't target under 13s globally.
   - International is true because the company likely serves international audiences based on the contact information in New Orleans (which isn't exclusive to the US).
   - Specific Audiences: Since there's no targeting of specific groups beyond age and privacy rights, this might be false.

7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy does talk about sharing data with third parties like ad servers.
   - Third Party is true because they do share data with others.

8. **User Choice/Control**: There’s a mention of users receiving information from third parties for marketing, but no direct control options are provided in the policy.
   - User Choice might be false since it doesn’t specify if users can opt out or have more control.

9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy does provide contact info to request data access or corrections.
   - User Control is true because they can contact for deletions and other actions.

10. **Data Security**: The policy mentions secure systems but doesn’t specify encryption or measures beyond that.
    - Data Security might be false as it only states a general approach, not specific security methods like encryption.

11. **Do Not Track**: There’s no mention of tracking users or refusing ads based on tracking.
    - Do Not Track is false since the policy doesn't address tracking technologies.

Putting this all together, I'll map each criterion to true or false based on my analysis.
