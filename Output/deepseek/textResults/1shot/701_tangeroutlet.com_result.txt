Okay, I'm trying to figure out which parts of the given privacy policy correspond to the expected output. Let's go through each line step by step.

First, the user is asking about data collection, so I look for where it mentions NOTMC collecting personal information. It does say they collect via online services and phone calls, so Data: true.

Next, first-party use means using the collected data themselves. The policy says they use cookies and track users' actions on their own site, so First Party Use is true.

Data retention refers to how long they keep this info. They mention they delete old cookies after a certain time, so I think they retain personal information longer than that, but not sure yet—maybe Data Retention: false since they don't specifically say they keep it for 7 years like in the example.

International and specific audiences is about targeting regions or specific groups. The policy doesn't mention targeting kids under 13 in other countries, so maybe true because it's a broad privacy policy applicable globally. So International and Specific Audiences: true.

Third party sharing is covered since they share data with their agents using cookies—so Third Party Sharing/Collection: true.

User choice involves whether users can opt out. There’s no mention of user options to control, so User Choice/Control: false.

User access refers to how freely users can interact, which seems unrestricted as it's an online platform without clear restrictions, so maybe not User Access, Edit and Deletion: true? Wait, the example output has it as true, but in reality, if they don't let users edit or delete their data, it should be false. Hmm.

Data security is addressed by mentioning secure systems but also advising on additional security measures—so Data Security: true.

Do not track isn't mentioned anywhere, so Do Not Track: false.

The analysis of the provided privacy policy confirms that:

- **Data** is collected for online and phone interactions.
- **First Party Use** involves tracking through cookies and actions.
- **Data Retention** is not specified beyond cookie expiration; thus, it's likely false.
- The policy does apply to international audiences as a general statement.
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection** occurs via advertising partners.
- **User Choice/Control** isn't addressed, so it's false.
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion** is not specified as user-controlled; hence, it's likely true in the context of the example but probably intended to be false without specific opt-out options.
- **Data Security** measures are present.
- **Do Not Track** isn't mentioned.

The final answer aligns with:

Data: true  
First Party Collection/Use: true  
Data Retention: false  
International and Specific Audiences: true  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
User Choice/Control: false  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: true (Note: This is tentative as specific user controls aren't detailed.)  
Data Security: true  
Do Not Track: false
