Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a detailed privacy policy for NOTMC and wants the corresponding data categorized into specific boolean flags.

First, I need to go through each part of the policy to identify key points. 

Starting with "Data Collection": The policy mentions they collect information like name, address, phone number, age, online profiles, payment info, account passwords, etc. So Data is definitely true.

Next, "Policy Change" â€” since there's no mention that this policy can change, I'll mark it as false.

For "First Party Collection/Use": They do collect personal info directly and use it for marketing, so that's true.

Data Retention: The policy says they don't keep records beyond a reasonable time. So Data Retention is false.

International and Specific Audiences: They address California residents with privacy rights and target adults under 13 as not their focus, but the main audience isn't specific to certain countries. Hmm, maybe I should mark this as true because of the California part?

Third Party Sharing/Collection: The policy talks about third-party cookies and ads, so that's definitely true.

User Choice/Control: They explain users can opt out by contacting, which is control, so User Choice is true.

User Access, Edit and Deletion: They offer a way to contact for information deletion, so access is allowed but editing isn't mentioned. Maybe User Access is true, others false.

Data Security: The policy mentions security measures but doesn't confirm they're 100% secure, so Data Security is false.

Do Not Track: No DNT settings are mentioned, so it's false.

Based on the analysis of the provided privacy policy and the expected output format:

Data | First Party Collection/Use | Policy Change | Third Party Sharing/Collection | User Choice/Control | User Access, Edit and Deletion | Data Retention | International and Specific Audiences | Do Not Track | User Security
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---
True | False | True | True | True | Partially true (only access is available) | False | True (for California) | False | False

Answer:  
Data: True  
First Party Collection/Use: True  
Policy Change: False  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: True  
User Choice/Control: True  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: Partially true only for access  
Data Retention: False  
International and Specific Audiences: True (for California)  
Do Not Track: False  
User Security: False
