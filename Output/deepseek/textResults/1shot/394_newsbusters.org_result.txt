Okay, so I have this problem where I need to evaluate a privacy policy based on certain criteria. The input is a long text about NOTMC's privacy practices, and the expected output is an object with boolean values corresponding to different aspects of the policy.

First, I'll read through the provided privacy policy carefully to understand each section. Then, for each criterion in the expected output, I need to determine whether that aspect is addressed or changed in the policy.

Looking at the criteria:

1. Data: Answer
2. Other: true
3. Policy Change: true
4. First Party Collection/Use: true
5. Data Retention: false
6. International and Specific Audiences: true
7. Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
8. User Choice/Control: true
9. User Access, Edit and Deletion: true
10. Data Security: true
11. Do Not Track: false

I'll go through each one step by step.

Data refers to personal information collected. The policy talks about cookies and personal data like user preferences, so I think this is covered.

Other might be a placeholder or a catch-all; since some aspects are not covered, maybe it's set to true.

Policy Change: The policy mentions that users can request changes in their account by contacting us, so there's an indication of possible changes.

First Party Collection/Use: Yes, because cookies and data are used for improving online experience and marketing.

Data Retention: It says NOTMC remembers user preferences but doesn't specify how long they keep the information. The policy doesn't mention retaining data beyond necessary, which could imply false if it's not explicitly stated. So maybe this is set to false unless more info is given.

International and Specific Audiences: Since it's targeted at New Orleans and possibly other locations, international aspects are covered as per the California privacy rights section.

Third Party Sharing/Collection: Yes, because cookies and ads from third-party services are mentioned.

User Choice/Control: The policy allows users to delete cookies but doesn't mention specific settings like tracking removal or opt-out options beyond what's already in place. So maybe this is true.

User Access, Edit and Deletion: It says NOTMC can remove user information upon request, so access, editing, and deletion are possible with enough info from the policy.

Data Security: The policy mentions using cookies to track users' preferences but doesn't explicitly state security measures like encryption or SSL. So maybe this is false unless it's implied.

Do Not Track: It's not clear if the policy enforces do-not-track mechanisms; however, in some cases, tracking might still happen through cookies regardless of do-not-track settings.

Putting it all together, I'll assign each boolean value based on my understanding.

The evaluation of the privacy policy against the given criteria results in the following:

- Data: true
- Other: true
- Policy Change: true
- First Party Collection/Use: true
- Data Retention: false
- International and Specific Audiences: true
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
- User Choice/Control: true
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: true
- Data Security: false
- Do Not Track: false

This assessment is based on the information provided in the policy text, where each criterion was analyzed for its presence or absence.
