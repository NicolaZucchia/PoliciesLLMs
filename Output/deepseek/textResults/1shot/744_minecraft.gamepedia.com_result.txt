Alright, let's go through this step by step. I need to analyze the given Privacy Policy text and determine which of the expected output categories apply. The expected outputs are Data, Other, Policy Change, etc., so I'll check each one against the policy.

First, looking at "Data." The policy mentions collecting personal information like names, addresses, phone numbers, and ages. So data is being collected—so that's true.

Next, "Other" usually refers to general terms or clauses in a privacy policy. Since there are several clauses beyond the main points, I'll mark this as true.

"Policy Change" would be true if the policy can change over time. The policy seems static but doesn't mention it being subject to change, so maybe not immediately, but since policies often have update clauses, perhaps it's considered a possibility—so maybe true.

"First Party Collection/Use" refers to using information from the same company. The policy clearly states that information is collected for their own purposes like marketing and events, so this is definitely true.

"Data Retention": The policy doesn't specify how long data is kept or if it's deleted after a certain period. It just mentions cookies and tracking actions without an end date, so I don't think we can assume retention periods—so probably false.

"International and Specific Audiences": The policy does mention California rights and children under 13, which are specific but not international unless they target other regions as well, which isn't clear. Maybe true if they do have international audiences.

"Third Party Sharing/Collection": The policy talks about cookies being used by third-party partners for ads, so yes, this is true.

"User Choice/Control": There's a mention of California Shine the Light rights and contact information—so users can exercise some control, though limited. So I'll mark this as true.

"User Access, Edit and Deletion": The policy doesn't provide clear methods for users to access, edit, or delete their data beyond contacting support—it just offers a way to request information and delete records if applicable—so probably false.

"Data Security": The policy mentions cookies but doesn't discuss encryption or technical security measures. So I think this is false.

"Do Not Track": The policy talks about tracking user actions for ads, so they do track users, meaning "Do Not Track" is not enforced here—so false.

Wait, let me double-check each category to make sure:

- Data: Yes.
- Other: Yes, as it covers general aspects beyond main points.
- Policy Change: Maybe a bit uncertain but considering policies can change, perhaps true.
- First Party Use: Definitely yes.
- Data Retention: No info on retention periods—so no.
- International/Audiences: Uncertain if they have international targets or not; since the text doesn't specify, maybe false.
- Third Party Sharing: Yes, as per the ad tech.
- User Control: They do offer some options like California rights and deletion requests—so true.
- Access/Edit/Delete: The policy only allows users to contact for information—not direct editing. So probably no.
- Data Security: No mention of security measures—no.
- Do Not Track: Since they track actions, this is false.

I think I initially got all the correct marks except maybe International and Specific Audiences if it's unclear whether they target beyond the US. But since there's a section about California rights and children under 13, perhaps it implies international scope—so true.
