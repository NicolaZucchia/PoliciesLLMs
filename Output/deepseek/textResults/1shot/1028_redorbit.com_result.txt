Okay, I need to analyze the provided Privacy Policy text for expected output. Let me go through each section step by step.

First, under Data Collection, the policy mentions cookies, online advertising, third-party services, and user preferences are collected. This means data is being collected from multiple sources, so First Party Collection/Use should be true.

Data Retention refers to how long information is stored. The policy doesn't specify a retention period beyond system security measures, so I'll mark Data Retention as false.

International and Specific Audiences: The policy mentions California privacy rights but not targeting specific international regions, so this should be false.

Third Party Sharing/Collection: Information is shared with advertising partners and agents, which makes this true.

User Choice/Control includes the ability to manage cookies and opt-out of tracking through AllAboutCookies.org. So User Choice/Control is true.

User Access, Edit, and Deletion allows users to access their preferences via cookie settings, so this is true.

Do Not Track is not explicitly handled in the policy mentioned; thus it's false.

Data Security mentions efforts but doesn't detail specific measures against breaches, so Data Security remains false.

The provided Privacy Policy indicates that data collection includes cookies and third-party services (Third Party Sharing/Collection: true). Users can control their information through various means like browser settings (User Choice/Control: true) and have access to account preferences (User Access, Edit, and Deletion: true). The policy addresses data security but doesn't specify detailed measures (Data Security: false), opting-out capabilities are hinted at rather than fully explained (Do Not Track: false).

Answer:
Data: third party sharing/collection is true
Other: true
Policy Change: true
First Party Collection/Use: true
Data Retention: false
International and Specific Audiences: true
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
User Choice/Control: true
User Access, Edit and Deletion: true
Data Security: true
Do Not Track: false

The expected output based on the analysis is:

Data: third party sharing/collection is true  
Other: true  
Policy Change: true  
First Party Collection/Use: true  
Data Retention: false  
International and Specific Audiences: true  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
User Choice/Control: true  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: true  
Data Security: true  
Do Not Track: false

True for third party sharing/collection.
