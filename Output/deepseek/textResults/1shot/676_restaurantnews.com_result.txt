Alright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user has provided a detailed privacy policy for NOTMC and an expected output with several boolean flags. My task is to evaluate each part of the policy against these flags.

First, I'll go through the policy text carefully. Looking at "Data Collection," it mentions collecting online activity data including browsing behavior, search terms, device usage patterns, and IP addresses. That points to First Party Collection/Use being true because they use this data for marketing. Data Retention is about how long this information is stored; since not specified, I'll assume it's false unless the policy says otherwise.

Next, "Data Retention" isn't addressed here, so that flag remains false. The policy talks about cookies and tracking, which are used for user experience improvement but also for marketing through third-party ads. So Third Party Sharing/Collection is true because of these ads. 

User Choice/Control involves whether users can manage their preferences or opt out, which isn't explicitly mentioned here, so that's false. The policy doesn't mention a consent-based system like a cookie or pixels for tracking. Data Security measures are present but not detailed enough to confirm it as true; thus, data security is also false.

The policy allows users to contact for California privacy rights and consent-related issues, which suggests they handle children's privacy by age 13, so International and Specific Audiences is true. They don't target children under 13, but do collect info from those over that age, hence that flag is true.

They use cookies without explicit consent in "Online Advertising," which implies Third Party Sharing/Collection is definitely true. User Access, Edit, and Deletion isn't covered here because they only offer email contact, so that's false. Do Not Track mechanisms aren't detailed, making that flag false as well.

Putting it all together, the flags should reflect whether each aspect of data handling applies to NOTMC based on their policy.

The provided text describes a comprehensive privacy policy for NOTMC, outlining how personal information is collected, used, and protected. Based on this policy, the following boolean flags can be evaluated:

1. **Data Collection**: Personal information (e.g., online activity, IP addresses) is collected to facilitate marketing efforts.  
2. **Data Retention**: The duration of data storage is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

The detailed evaluation of each flag is as follows:

- **First Party Collection/Use**: True (data is used for marketing purposes).  
- **Data Retention**: False (retention period not specified).  
- **International and Specific Audiences**: True (addresses California privacy rights and does not target minors under 13).  
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True (cookies and tracking technologies are shared with third-party advertising partners).  
- **User Choice/Control**: False (no explicit mention of user consent or preferences management).  
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False (only contact information provided for queries about privacy rights).  
- **Data Security**: False (specific security measures not detailed in the text).  
- **Do Not Track**: False (no clear mention or implementation of Do Not Track mechanisms).

The final answer aligns with these evaluations.
