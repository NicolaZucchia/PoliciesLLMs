Okay, so I need to analyze the given privacy policy text and determine which of the specific features apply. Let me go through each feature one by one.

1. **Data Collection**: The policy mentions collecting information like personal details for online services, cookies, and third-party interactions. So this is true.
2. **First Party Collection/Use**: It talks about using the user's data for marketing and website improvements, which is first party use. True.
3. **Data Retention**: There's no mention of how long data is kept beyond what’s stated as secure, so I can say false.
4. **International/Audiences**: The policy is mainly in English but targets New Orleans; it doesn't specify international scope. So maybe not true.
5. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: It discusses sharing with advertising partners and third parties for ads. Definitely true.
6. **User Choice/Control**: I don’t see anything about user preferences or opting out, so this is false.
7. **User Access/Edit/Delete**: There's no info on how users can access their data, so it's false.
8. **Data Security**: It mentions cookies and security measures but doesn't detail how secure the data is. So maybe not true?
9. **Do Not Track**: The policy allows tracking via cookies but doesn’t have a do not track mechanism. So this could be considered false or partially applicable.

Wait, for "Data Security," since they mention using cookies to track and improve experiences but don't specify encryption, I might need to mark it as false because the text doesn't indicate strong security measures like HTTPS or SSL. Similarly, "Do Not Track" is a feature some policies have, allowing users to opt out of tracking, but this policy seems to use tracking methods without an option for users to prevent it.

So summarizing:

- Data Collection: true
- First Party Use: true
- Third Party Sharing: true
- Data Security: false
- Do Not Track: false

The rest are either not mentioned or explicitly false.
