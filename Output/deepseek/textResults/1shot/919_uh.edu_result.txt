Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to categorize the given Privacy Policy into the specific areas mentioned in the expected output. Let me read through the policy carefully.

First, the policy mentions that NOTMC collects personal information from users when they use their Online Services. This includes details about how they interact with events like online advertising and social networking on third-party sites. So, it looks like they're collecting first party data because it's directly related to user interactions within their own platforms.

The policy also talks about tracking users across different devices and locations using cookies. They mentioned that some information might be stored across international borders, which suggests they handle data for audiences outside the U.S., particularly in New Orleans. That falls under International and Specific Audiences.

They offer various methods for users to provide feedback or opt out of certain programs, like through email and phone contact. This indicates there's a mechanism for user choice and control over their personal information.

Cookies are used for tracking and improving user experience, which means NOTMC is using cookies for both first-party use and third-party sharing because they also appear on other sites users might visit after interacting with NOTMC's services.

The policy includes clear instructions about how data is retained—specifically mentioning not keeping it beyond 30 days—but then later states that they don't target children. This seems contradictory, but since the 30-day retention applies to most users except those under 13, I think Data Retention should be false.

The inclusion of California privacy rights and child protection measures suggests they are aware of these regulations, which probably means they're compliant with data security standards in those areas. Since the policy itself doesn't mention specific data security technologies or policies beyond cookies and retention periods, I'd categorize Data Security as true but only to the extent described.

They also address users' ability to access, edit, and delete their information through contact methods like email and phone, so User Access/Edit/Deletion is true. Additionally, they give users control over data collection for marketing purposes by allowing them to opt out or request information lists, which fits under User Choice/Control.

Notably, the policy doesn't mention disabling cookies or providing do-not-track signals directly, but it does allow users to contact them with specific inquiries, so Do Not Track is false.

The provided Privacy Policy can be categorized as follows:

- **First Party Collection/Use:** true
- **Data Retention:** false (Most data is retained for up to 30 days; children under 13 are exempt)
- **International and Specific Audiences:** true
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection:** true
- **User Choice/Control:** true
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion:** true
- **Data Security:** true (Cookies used for tracking, but no direct mention of advanced security measures)
- **Do Not Track:** false

Answer:
{"Data": "false", "Other": "true", "Policy Change": "true", "First Party Collection/Use": "true", "Data Retention": "false", "International and Specific Audiences": "true", "Third Party Sharing/Collection": "true", "User Choice/Control": "true", "User Access, Edit and Deletion": "true", "Data Security": "true", "Do Not Track": "false"}
