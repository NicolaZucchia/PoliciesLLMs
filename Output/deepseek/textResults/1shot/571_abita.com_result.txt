Alright, I need to analyze the provided privacy policy text and categorize it into specific areas as per the user's request. The categories are Data, Other, Policy Change, First Party Collection/Use, Data Retention, International and Specific Audiences, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Choice/Control, User Access, Edit and Deletion, Data Security, Do Not Track.

First, I'll go through each section of the policy to identify mentions in these categories.

1. **Data**: The policy states that NOTMC collects personal information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, payment information, etc. So "Data" is true.

2. **Other**: The policy includes sections about cookies, online advertising, third-party websites, children's privacy, and California privacy rights. This falls under the "Other" category, so it's true.

3. **Policy Change**: There’s no mention of when or how often policies change, nor any process for updates. So this is false.

4. **First Party Collection/Use**: The policy mentions collecting information about website visits and personal data to improve services, track usage, etc., which indicates first-party use. True.

5. **Data Retention**: It doesn’t specify how long the data is kept or if there's a retention period beyond user activity, so this is false.

6. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy mentions California-specific requests but doesn't address international users, so it's true for the specific audience part, but not for international. However, since "International and Specific Audiences" usually refers to both aspects together, I'll consider if it applies here. It does touch on California, which is a specific audience in an international context? Maybe true.

7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy talks about sharing data with ad partners and third-party websites, so this is true.

8. **User Choice/Control**: There's no info on how users can manage their preferences or opt-out options, so false.

9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy mentions contacting for access to personal information but doesn't allow users to edit or delete themselves. So false.

10. **Data Security**: It states that measures are taken to protect data, though not 100% secure, implying some security measures exist. True.

11. **Do Not Track**: The policy doesn’t mention any tracking mechanisms like cookies for analytics but does talk about cookies and advertising. However, "Do Not Track" typically refers to tracking technologies users can block. Since the policy mentions tracking through ads and cookies, this might be false unless it specifically prohibits such trackers.

Wait, considering that the policy talks about using cookies for advertising which involves tracking, so maybe "Do Not Track" is addressed by allowing users to opt-out via browser settings? But the policy doesn't mention any DNT mechanisms. So I'll mark it as false.
