Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to answer this query about NOTMC's privacy policy. The user provided a detailed policy document, which is quite lengthy. They want me to analyze specific aspects of the policy and determine whether each statement in their expected output is correct or not.

First, I'll read through the policy carefully to understand what they're asking for. Their expected output has several categories: Data collection and use, data retention, international audiences, third-party sharing, user choice, access/edit/delete options, data security, do not track policies, and whether a policy change is needed.

Looking at each point in their query:

1. **Data Collection and Use**: They mention that NOTMC collects personal information through cookies, social media links, and advertising partners. This seems accurate as per the policy provided.
2. **Data Retention**: The policy states they keep data for as long as necessary to fulfill services or meet legal obligations, with a 30-day notice period if data is deleted. That doesn't mean they retain indefinitely; thus, this statement should be false.
3. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy doesn't target individuals in the US specifically but mentions nothing about international audiences. However, since it's an English policy, it could imply it applies globally unless specified otherwise. But given no info on targeting other regions, I'll consider this as not necessarily true.
4. **Third-Party Sharing/Collection**: They do share data with third-party advertising partners using cookies and pixels, which is correct.
5. **User Choice/Control**: The policy does mention users can contact for privacy inquiries, but there's no clear information about cookie preferences or management. So, I'm unsure; maybe not explicitly stated as 'true'.
6. **User Access/Edit/Delete**: The policy allows users to request deletions via email, which implies they have control over their data.
7. **Data Security**: They mention using cookies and other measures but don't specify if these are sufficient or secure enough. So, this might be true in the sense that they do take security measures, even if not 100%.
8. **Do Not Track**: The policy doesn't mention any mechanism for users to opt-out of tracking, so this is false.

Putting it all together, I'll evaluate each point based on the information provided in the policy document and mark them accordingly.
