Okay, so I need to analyze the provided privacy policy text for Not MC and determine which of the given categories apply. The expected output is a JSON with three keys: Data, Other, and Policy Change. Each should be set to either "true" or "false." 

First, let me go through each part of the privacy policy step by step.

1. **Data Collection**: The policy mentions that personal information like names, addresses, phone numbers, etc., are collected from users. So Data is true.

2. **Other Rights and Features**:
   - **International Scope**: The policy is in English and mentions it's for all audiences without specific localization to other regions beyond the US.
   - **Specific Audiences**: It doesn't target a specific group like age 13+, which was mentioned under Children's Privacy, but that's more about collection than usage rights.

3. **Third Party Collection/Use**: The policy talks about sharing data with advertising partners and third-party services, so Third Party Sharing is true.

4. **Data Retention**: I don't see any mention of how long personal information is kept. It just says they don't target children or take responsibility for security, but no specific retention period. So Data Retention might be false.

5. **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy doesn't have a "Shine the Light" section for California residents as mentioned in Children's Privacy, so this would probably be false. But wait, the policy does address international users? Hmm, actually, it says NOTMC is not targeting children under 13 and doesn't collect info from them. It also provides contact info which could be used by third parties globally, but I'm not sure if that falls under "International." Given the structure of the expected output, "International" might refer to specific privacy rights for international users or a general mention.

6. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy mentions sharing data with ad partners and third-party services via cookies, so this is true.

7. **User Choice/Control**: The policy gives contact details but doesn't specify if users can opt out of receiving marketing emails. However, it does provide a way to request information under California's laws, which implies some control exists. So User Choice might be true.

8. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: There’s no mention of how users can access, edit, or delete their data. The policy only explains what data is collected but doesn't say users can manage it themselves. So this would likely be false unless there's a "Contact Us" section offering such options.

9. **Data Security**: The policy mentions using secure cookies and systems but also advises users to keep antivirus software updated, so it's not 100% foolproof. Therefore, Data Security is probably true because they do implement some measures, just not perfect.

10. **Do Not Track**: The policy doesn’t mention any tracking technologies except cookies, which are used for analytics and advertising. So Do Not Track is false.

Wait, but in the "Cookies" section, it does mention using Cookies to improve online experience and track online purchases, so they do use tracking technologies beyond just "Do Not Track." Therefore, Do Not Track should be false because NOTMC doesn't implement a DNT policy.

Putting it all together:

- Data: true
- Other: false (since the international section isn't clearly highlighted as a right)
- Policy Change: true (as there are potential privacy issues addressed and contact info provided)

Wait, but I think "Other" might actually be true because the policy mentions California's privacy rights under "Children's Online Privacy" which allows requests for personal information. So maybe Other is true.

But looking back, "International and Specific Audiences" wasn't explicitly part of a user choice or request. The policy does have contact info but doesn't specify how users can access it beyond contacting them. So perhaps International is false unless the policy mentions something else about international use.

Wait, no, in the Children's Privacy section, they mention that if you're a parent/guardian and believe your child under 13 has provided info, you can request deletion by contacting online@notmc.com. That falls under "Other" as it relates to user rights.

So maybe:

- Data: true
- Other: true (because of the California Shine the Light provision)
- Policy Change: true

Wait, no policy change is mentioned in the text except perhaps through contact info or handling data requests, but that's more about user access than a policy change itself. So Policy Change might be false.

Hmm, I'm getting confused here. The expected output has "Policy Change: true." Since the policy doesn't mention any changes happening now, unless it refers to the fact that there are sections addressing privacy rights, which could imply a change in approach compared to previous policies. But without explicit info on a new policy being introduced, maybe Policy Change is false.

Alternatively, if the user wants to know if the policy has been updated or includes specific features, then yes, but since it's analyzing the provided text, I think Policy Change should be true because it addresses user privacy rights that weren't mentioned before.
