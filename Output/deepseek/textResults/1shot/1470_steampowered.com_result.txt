Okay, I need to evaluate whether each of the expected output categories applies to NOTMC's privacy policy based on the provided text. Let me go through each category one by one.

1. **Data Collection**: The policy states that they collect online activity and user input for registration and usage tracking. So yes.
2. **User Choice/Control**: They mention cookies, advertising management partners, etc., giving users control over preferences and ad targeting. Yes.
3. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: Information is shared with third parties like advertisers, social media operators. Yes.
4. **Data Retention**: Policy doesn't specify retention periods beyond what's necessary for tracking, so likely true if they keep activity logs indefinitely.
5. **International Scope**: The policy is written in English without mentioning regions, but the user didn't ask about specific regions, so I think false here since it doesn't target any one place exclusively.
6. **Do Not Track**: Not mentioned anywhere; the policy doesnâ€™t include DNT mechanisms. False.
7. **Cookies Usage**: Yes, they use cookies to track users and improve site experience.
8. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: Users can manage cookie settings and have some control over their data through third parties, so yes.
9. **Data Security**: They mention security measures but don't specify encryption or authentication methods; not sure if it's "true" without more info.
10. **First Party Collection/Use**: Personal information is used for services like registration and marketing, so yes.

I think I might have been a bit uncertain about data retention (maybe true) and cookies' security aspects (perhaps false). Also, international scope was tricky since it's not explicitly mentioned as targeting a specific region.

The evaluation based on the provided privacy policy is as follows:

- **Data Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: True
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **Data Retention**: True (based on indefinite tracking)
- **International and Specific Audiences**: False (policy not region-specific)
- **Do Not Track**: False
- **Cookies Usage**: True
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: True
- **Data Security**: Likely True but depends on specific measures not detailed here
- **First Party Collection/Use**: True

This analysis assumes standard data security practices and the absence of explicit denial in the policy.
