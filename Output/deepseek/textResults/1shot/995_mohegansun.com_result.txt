Alright, so I need to analyze this provided Privacy Policy for NOTMC and determine which of the specified categories apply. Let me go through each point step by step.

First, looking at the sections:

1. **Collection of Information**: The policy mentions that they collect information from users when they visit their sites, register, log in, use features, etc. This seems to fall under First Party Collection/Use. So I'll mark that as true.

2. **Data Retention**: It says NOTMC uses cookies and similar technologies for better user experience but doesn't specify how long this information is retained. Since there's no mention of duration or retention policies beyond what's necessary, it's unclear. Therefore, Data Retention should be marked as false unless more info is provided.

3. **International Audience**: The policy is in English and is intended to apply globally, considering the presence of a contact address that doesn't specify a country. This falls under International and Specific Audiences, so true.

4. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: They do collect information through cookies for advertising purposes and third-party services. Third Party Sharing/Collection should be true.

5. **User Choice/Control**: The policy allows users to contact them regarding privacy rights but doesn't mention if users can opt out of tracking or data collection. So User Choice/Control is false.

6. **Data Security**: They state that their systems are secure, though no 100% guarantee exists. However, the absence of info on vulnerabilities means we have to assume based on provided info; since they do use cookies and similar tech, it's somewhat secured. So Data Security should be true.

7. **Do Not Track**: The policy mentions cookies but doesn't mention any specific Do Not Track mechanisms or that users can opt-out. Thus, Do Not Track is false.

8. **User Access, Edit, Deletion**: There’s no indication that users can access, edit, or delete their data through the provided contact methods. So this should be marked as false.

9. **First Party Collection/Use**: This was already covered under point 1, so it's true here too to ensure consistency.

Wait, in my initial analysis, I might have missed some points. Let me check again:

- The policy mentions that users can request their information through California Shine the Light requests, which falls under User Choice/Control as true.
  
- The parts about cookies and advertising imply that user data is being shared with third parties for marketing purposes, so Third Party Sharing/Collection should be marked as true.

Putting it all together:


Other: This likely refers to if there are other privacy aspects covered beyond what's listed. Since it’s comprehensive, Other should be true.

Policy Change: The policy might allow for changes without notice, so Policy Change is true.

First Party Collection/Use: As established earlier, this is true.

Data Retention: Still unclear from the provided info; no specifics on retention period, so probably false unless more details are given. Since I don't have that, it's safer to leave as false.

International and Specific Audiences: True because it applies globally, considering the contact address in a non-specific U.S. city but intended for international use.

Third Party Sharing/Collection: True due to cookies and third-party ads.

User Choice/Control: True since users can request their info through California's process.

User Access, Edit and Deletion: False as no methods provided on how to access/edit/delete data.

Data Security: True in the sense that they do use measures like cookies but without 100% security, so maybe this should be false. However, given that they do implement some security practices, it's a bit ambiguous. I think Data Security is intended to mean if they secure user data adequately, which they don't fully guarantee, so perhaps mark as false.

Do Not Track: False since no mechanisms mentioned for Do Not Track.

Wait, in the initial expected output, Data Security was marked as true. But considering that their main focus is on tracking and ads without specific security measures beyond cookies, maybe Data Security should be false. I need to reconcile this.

The policy mentions using Cookies but doesn't specify how they are managed (e.g., removing cookies after session). So the lack of details means we can't confirm data security comprehensively. Therefore, Data Security is probably false unless more info is provided, which it isn't here.

So adjusting:

Data: true

Other: true

Policy Change: true

First Party Collection/Use: true

Data Retention: Not covered, so false

International and Specific Audiences: true

Third Party Sharing/Collection: true

User Choice/Control: true

User Access, Edit and Deletion: false

Data Security: False (since no comprehensive security measures mentioned)

Do Not Track: false
