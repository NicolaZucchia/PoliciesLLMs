Okay, I need to analyze the provided privacy policy text and determine which of the expected output categories apply. The user has given specific points they want evaluated: Data Collection, Policy Change, First Party Collection/Use, etc.

First, let's go through each point in the Privacy Policy:

1. **Data**: They collect information like names, addresses, phone numbers via online forms and social media links.
2. **Policy Change**: The policy is not changing; it's a static document explaining current practices.
3. **First Party Collection/Use**: They do collect personal info themselves through forms and websites (first party).
4. **Data Retention**: The policy doesn't specify retention periods, so I'll say false for now.
5. **International and Specific Audiences**: Targeting New Orleans residents; no global scope yet.
6. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: They share data with third-party vendors for marketing purposes.
7. **User Choice/Control**: They offer ways to contact for inquiries but don't mention user opt-out options.
8. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy doesnâ€™t provide clear methods for users to access or delete their data.
9. **Data Security**: They mention using cookies and some security measures, but it's not comprehensive enough.
10. **Do Not Track**: No mention of tracking technologies like DTAs or DPCs.

Based on this analysis, only the points that are definitely true (First Party Collection/Use, Third Party Sharing/Collection) apply. The rest either don't exist or aren't specified in the policy.

Answer:  
Data: First Party Collection/Use is true.  
Other: true.  
Policy Change: false.  
First Party Collection/Use: true.  
Data Retention: false.  
International and Specific Audiences: false.  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true.  
User Choice/Control: false.  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: false.  
Data Security: false.  
Do Not Track: false.  

The expected output is:

First Party Collection/Use: true  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true
