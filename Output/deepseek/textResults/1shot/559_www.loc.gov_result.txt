Alright, I need to analyze this query about NOTMC's privacy policy. The user has provided a detailed policy and wants me to evaluate several aspects based on the expected output.

First, I'll go through each aspect one by one. Let's start with Data Collection: Does NOTMC collect any data? Yes, they do. So that should be marked as true.

Next is First Party Collection/Use: The policy mentions cookies, online advertising, social networking, and third-party services, all of which are their own properties. That makes sense, so this aspect is also true.

Data Retention: The policy says NOTMC uses Cookies but doesn't specify retaining them indefinitely or for how long. Without explicit information about data retention periods, I'll mark this as false.

International and Specific Audiences: Since the policy mentions California Privacy Rights and children's privacy under 13, it's clear they handle audiences in different regions and have specific policies for certain groups. So that's true.

Third Party Sharing/Collection: The policy talks about third-party services, cookies from ad networks, and data used for marketing. This indicates they do share data with others, so true.

User Choice/Control: There's no mention of user preferences or control options like opting out of tracking or ads. So this is false.

User Access, Edit and Deletion: No details are given on how users can access, edit, or delete their data. Thus, false here.

Data Security: The policy mentions using Cookies to track but doesn't talk about encryption or security measures beyond that. Still, they do use cookies which help with security by improving user experience without overcomplicating the system. So I'll mark this as true.

Do Not Track: There's no information indicating NOTMC has a Do Not Track mechanism. They focus on tracking for analytics and marketing, so false here.

Putting it all together, only some aspects are true based on what's provided in the policy.

The expected output is based on evaluating whether each aspect of NOTMC's privacy policy aligns with the user's request. Here's the evaluation:

- **Data Collection**: The policy mentions cookies, online advertising, and third-party services as methods for collecting data. This matches "Data: Answer", so it should be marked `true`.
  
- **First Party Collection/Use**: The policy explains how NOTMC uses its own cookies and ad networks to track user behavior and improve their experience. This also aligns with the expected output, so it's `true`.

- **Data Retention**: The policy does not specify how long personal information is retained, which means we cannot confirm this aspect as `true`. Therefore, it should be `false`.

- **International and Specific Audiences**: The policy mentions California Privacy Rights and children under 13, indicating handling of specific audiences. This aligns with the expected output, so it's `true`.

- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The policy refers to third-party services for online advertising purposes. This matches the expected output, so it's `true`.

- **User Choice/Control**: The policy does not mention user control options like opting out of tracking or ads. Therefore, this is `false`.

- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The policy does not provide details on how users can access, edit, or delete their information. Hence, it's `false`.

- **Data Security**: While the policy mentions using cookies to track user behavior, it does not explicitly state strong security measures beyond that. Therefore, this is `false`.

- **Do Not Track**: The policy does not indicate the presence of a do-not-track mechanism. Thus, it's `false`.

The final evaluation matches some aspects but not all. Here are the results:

  "Data": {
    "Collection": true,
