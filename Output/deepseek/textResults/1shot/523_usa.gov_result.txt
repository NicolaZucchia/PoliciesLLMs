Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to answer the user's query based on the provided Privacy Policy. The user has given me a list of features related to privacy policies and expects a boolean response for each. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what each part of the user's request means. They want me to evaluate certain aspects of NOTMC's Privacy Policy: whether it's Data, Other, Policy Change, etc., true or false based on their description.

Looking at the first entry in their expected output, "Data: Answer" seems a bit unclear. Maybe they mean that the policy states something about data? But since all policies usually mention data collection, perhaps this refers to specific details like what kind of data is collected ( Personally Identifiable Information or PII). I need to check the policy for such mentions.

The next part is "Other: true". This might refer to whether any other information outside the standard terms is included. The policy seems comprehensive but doesn't mention anything beyond what's typical in a privacy policy, so maybe this remains true as per their expectation.

"Policy Change: true". It makes sense because companies often update policies periodically. I should look for a section where they mention that policies can change and if there's an updated version available.

Moving on to "First Party Collection/Use: true". The policy says NOTMC collects information through their Online Services, so this likely refers to collection from their own users (first party), so yes, it's true.

"Data Retention: false". Data retention usually refers to how long personal data is kept. If the policy states that they don't retain data beyond a certain period or delete it automatically, then this would be false.

"International and Specific Audiences: true". Since the policy mentions California Privacy Rights and children under 13, it's targeting specific audiences, so this should be true.

"Third Party Sharing/Collection: true". The policy does mention sharing data with third parties for marketing purposes, so yes to this.

"User Choice/Control: true". The policy doesn't explicitly say if users can control their data choices beyond reporting breaches. Maybe I'm missing something here—perhaps it's a "false".

Wait, looking again, the policy mentions that users can opt out by contacting them, but does it allow for more control? Since the user choice section isn't clearly defined in the policy provided, maybe this should be false.

"User Access, Edit and Deletion: true". The policy doesn’t provide clear information on whether users can access, edit, or delete their data themselves. It only mentions reporting breaches. So perhaps "false".

"Data Security: true". They do mention measures to protect Personal Information but don't explicitly state if these are sufficient. However, given the information provided, it's safe to assume they're acknowledging some security measures, so maybe this is true.

"Do Not Track: false". The policy doesn’t have a dedicated section for Do Not Track signals, so this should be "false".

Putting it all together based on my analysis:

Data: PII is collected and used, but without more specifics, maybe "true".
Other: True as per the user's request.
Policy Change: Definitely true since policies can change.
First Party Collection/Use: True because they collect info from their users.
Data Retention: False because it doesn't specify retention periods or deletion automatically.
International and Specific Audiences: True due to targeting California and children under 13.
Third Party Sharing/Collection: True as they share data for marketing.
User Choice/Control: Since the policy mentions users can opt out by contacting, this is true.
User Access, Edit and Deletion: False because there's no info on user actions beyond reporting.
Data Security: True based on their measures mentioned.
Do Not Track: False.

So adjusting my initial response:
</think>

Data: true  
Other: true  
Policy Change: true  
First Party Collection/Use: true  
Data Retention: false  
International and Specific Audiences: true  
Third Party Sharing/Collection: true  
User Choice/Control: true  
User Access, Edit and Deletion: false  
Data Security: true  
Do Not Track: false
