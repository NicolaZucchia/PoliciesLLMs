Alright, let me try to figure this out. The user provided a lengthy privacy policy from NOTMC and expects it broken down into specific categories with booleans for each category.

First, I'll go through the policy section by section to identify where information fits. 

1. **Data Collection**: It mentions collecting data like names, addresses, phone numbers which is first party use.
2. **Privacy Practices**: They talk about cookies and tracking users' actions, so data retention isn't mentioned hereâ€”maybe it's covered elsewhere?
3. **Third Party Sharing**: They do share data with third parties for marketing, so that should be true.
4. **User Choice/Control**: The policy allows users to manage their preferences but doesn't mention explicit opt-out options like "Do Not Track" directly.
5. **Do Not Track**: I don't see any mention of this feature.
6. **International Audience**: Since it's about New Orleans, unless they have a global presence, this might be true for U.S.-based users only.

I think that covers the main points to set each boolean accordingly.
