Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a user who provided two different datasets with specific queries about each dataset. Each query asks whether a particular statement is true or false based on the given dataset.

First, I need to understand what each part of the query entails:
- **Data**: This refers to statements that are directly related to how data is collected, used, retained, etc.
- **Other**: This could be about privacy policies, security measures, embedding third-party sites, or other non-data aspects like children's privacy or comments.
- **Policy Change**: This would involve whether there has been a change in the policy compared to previous versions.
- **First Party Collection/Use**: Whether data is collected and used by the same company (Smithsonian) or external parties.
- **Data Retention**: How long personal information is kept.
- **International and Specific Audiences**: Whether the dataset covers international users or specific groups.
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: If third-party data sources are involved.
- **User Choice/Control**: Whether users have control over their data, like opting out.
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: Whether users can access, edit, or delete their data.
- **Data Security**: The measures in place to protect user data.
- **Do Not Track**: Whether the dataset includes a do-not-track feature.

Now, looking at the first dataset:

1. **Statement about data collection and use by Smithsonian (directly)**: True
2. **Statement about data retention for 7 years**: True
3. **Statement about international audiences**: True
4. **Third-party sharing**: True because it mentions sharing with other organizations.
5. **User choice to opt out**: True, they provide methods to unsubscribe or remove information.

So, the answer would be that all these statements are true except for user access/edit/delete and do-not-track, which might not apply here.

Moving on to the second dataset:

1. **Statement about data collection by Smithsonian (directly)**: The query says "No" but there's no statement provided in the dataset.
2. **Other aspects**: It includes things like third-party links, children's privacy, comments, etc., which are relevant and true.

Therefore, for this dataset, Data is True because it has statements directly related to data handling by Smithsonian. Other is also True since it covers other areas. Policy Change might not be applicable here as there's no change mentioned. First Party Collection/Use is False if there's no statement about it. Data Retention isn't addressed in the provided query.

Wait, perhaps I misread. The user actually has two separate datasets and two sets of queries. Each dataset is queried separately with specific statements. So for each dataset, we need to evaluate whether each of these 10 statements is true or false based on what's provided in that dataset.

So, first dataset: all the statements are covered except access/edit/delete and do-not-track because they aren't mentioned. But looking at the user’s expected output, it seems like only certain aspects are considered for Data or Other.

Wait, actually, each query has 10 parts (Data to Do Not Track), but in this case, the first dataset doesn't mention things about access/edit/delete or do-not-track. Therefore, those would be False because there's no information indicating whether users can access, edit, delete data, or if they're informed about tracking.

But according to the user’s expected output for the first dataset, only Data is True; Other is also True, implying that all aspects except some are addressed. However, based on my analysis, since certain parts like User Access aren't mentioned, those should be False.

Similarly, in the second dataset, since there's no mention of Data collection directly by Smithsonian (the query says "No" but for this dataset), it might mean that first party collection isn't covered, hence False. But I'm a bit confused here because the user seems to mix two datasets into one response.

I think perhaps each query corresponds to its own dataset, and we have to evaluate based on each individually.

So, in conclusion:

For the first dataset:
- Data: True (statements about collection, retention, international use, third-party sharing, opt-out)
- Other: True (includes comments, embedding sites, etc.)
- Policy Change: Not addressed
- First Party Collection/Use: Not directly mentioned
- Data Retention: True
- International and Specific Audiences: True
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: True
- User Choice/Control: True (opt-out)
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: False (no info on this)
- Data Security: True

For the second dataset:
- Data: Not directly mentioned in the query ("No")
- Other: True (includes comments, embedding sites, etc.)
- Policy Change: Not addressed
- First Party Collection/Use: Not mentioned
- Data Retention: No relevant statement
- International and Specific Audiences: No info
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: True
- User Choice/Control: Not mentioned
- User Access, Edit and Deletion: False
- Data Security: Mentioned about security measures

But since the user provided specific expected outputs for each dataset, it's clear that they want to know which statements are true or false based on each dataset individually.

I think I've got a handle on how to structure this. Now, let me put together the thought process clearly.

Here is a structured summary of the analysis and answers:

### Analysis of Each Dataset

#### First Dataset:
- **Data**: True (covers collection, retention, international use, third-party sharing, opt-out)
- **Other**: True (includes comments, embedding sites, etc.)
- **Policy Change**: N/A
- **First Party Collection/Use**: N/A (not addressed in statements)
- **Data Retention**: True
- **International and Specific Audiences**: True
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: True (opt-out available)
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False (no info provided)
- **Data Security**: True

#### Second Dataset:
- **Data**: N/A ("No" to direct collection by Smithsonian")
- **Other**: True (includes comments, embedding sites, etc.)
- **Policy Change**: N/A
- **First Party Collection/Use**: N/A (not addressed in statements)
- **Data Retention**: N/A (no relevant statement)
- **International and Specific Audiences**: N/A
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: N/A (no info provided)
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False (no info provided)
- **Data Security**: True

### Answers Based on Each Dataset:

#### First Dataset:
- **Data**: True
- **Other**: True
- **Policy Change**: N/A
- **First Party Collection/Use**: N/A
- **Data Retention**: True
- **International and Specific Audiences**: True
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: True
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False
- **Data Security**: True

#### Second Dataset:
- **Data**: N/A
- **Other**: True
- **Policy Change**: N/A
- **First Party Collection/Use**: N/A
- **Data Retention**: N/A
- **International and Specific Audiences**: N/A
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: N/A
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False
- **Data Security**: True

### Summary:
Each dataset provides specific information that can be evaluated for the truthfulness of each statement. The first dataset supports most statements except those related to user access/edit/delete and data security, while the second dataset focuses on third-party sharing and user choice controls but does not confirm direct collection by Smithsonian or provide details on other aspects like data retention.
