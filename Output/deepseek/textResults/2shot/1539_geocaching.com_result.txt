Okay, so I have to analyze this Privacy Statement from the Smithsonian Institution and determine whether each of the following aspects is true or false based on the information provided. The aspects are:

1. Data Collection/Use
2. Data Retention
3. International and Specific Audiences
4. Third Party Sharing/Collection
5. User Choice/Control
6. User Access, Edit, Deletion (AED)
7. Data Security
8. Do Not Track

I'll go through each point one by one and check if the Smithsonian's Privacy Statement supports it.

1. **Data Collection/Use**: The statement mentions that the Smithsonian can provide your information to various entities like government agencies, courts, Members of the public under a specific directive, and others as needed for law enforcement or litigation purposes. It also talks about protecting security and integrity, which involves sharing with officials or committees. Additionally, there's a note about children not being collected without parental consent. So yes, they do collect data for these purposes.

2. **Data Retention**: The statement doesn't specify how long personal information is retained. There’s no mention of a retention policy or any obligations under federal regulations like GLBA or CCPA that might set specific durations. So I can’t confirm this as true; it's unclear from the text provided.

3. **International and Specific Audiences**: The Smithsonian operates in the U.S., so unless they have international operations mentioned, which isn't clear here, there’s no indication of targeting different audiences internationally or having specific policies for them beyond the U.S. So probably false.

4. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The statement says that outside vendors are used to process transactions securely and that some member information is shared with non-profit organizations. It also mentions sharing with various entities like courts, Members of Congress, etc., which are third parties. So this should be true.

5. **User Choice/Control**: The statement allows users to opt-out of receiving further correspondence from non-Smithsonian entities but doesn't mention whether they can control collection or usage beyond that. It doesn’t specify user consent for data collection or use elsewhere, so probably false unless it implies some level of control through opting out.

6. **User Access, Edit, Deletion (AED)**: The statement says there are mechanisms to notify Smithsonian officials about certain actions but doesn't mention users having access, editing, or deleting their own information. It refers to protecting information for security and legal purposes, so this is likely false.

7. **Data Security**: The statement mentions using outside vendors who comply with PCI standards for secure transactions. It also talks about monitoring network traffic to prevent unauthorized access. So yes, data is secured as per these measures.

8. **Do Not Track**: There's no mention of a do-not-track mechanism or any policy against tracking user activity. So this is false.

Based on the analysis of the Smithsonian Institution's Privacy Statement, here is the evaluation for each aspect:

1. **Data Collection/Use**: True
2. **Data Retention**: Unclear (False)
3. **International and Specific Audiences**: False
4. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
5. **User Choice/Control**: Unclear but likely limited control (False)
6. **User Access, Edit, Deletion (AED)**: False
7. **Data Security**: True
8. **Do Not Track**: False

The final evaluation is:

- Data Collection/Use: True  
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: True  
- Data Security: True  

All other aspects are either false or not explicitly addressed in the provided text, making them likely to be false based on the information given.
