Alright, I need to analyze the provided Privacy Statement for the Smithsonian Institution's Websites based on the user's query. The query asks whether certain aspects of privacy policy statements are true or false. The expected output is a structured list indicating each statement as either Data, Other, Policy Change, etc., with True or False.

First, I'll read through the Privacy Statement carefully to understand its contents and identify key points related to data handling, user rights, security, and third-party interactions.

Starting from the top:

1. **Data Collection**: The first paragraph talks about collecting personal information for various purposes like research, surveys, marketing, etc. It mentions using secure servers with encryption. This clearly relates to First Party Collection/Use, Data Retention, Security, and Do Not Track features. So these statements are likely True.

2. **User Access and Editing**: The statement allows users to view and edit their personal information, with a note that Smithsonian officials can also make changes on behalf of users who don't have access. This suggests that User Access, Edit, and Deletion is allowed but with limitations. However, the specific question about whether they can be edited or deleted isn't addressed beyond the official intervention. So I think User Access, Edit, and Deletion would be False.

3. **Third Party Sharing**: The Privacy Statement mentions sharing information with third parties for purposes like conducting research, fulfilling contracts, etc., but also states that sharing requires consent except in specific cases like law enforcement or legal proceedings. This indicates Third Party Sharing/Collection is True.

4. **Data Retention and Usage Limits**: It talks about using information only within Smithsonian units and protecting it against unauthorized access. However, the statement doesn't specify how long personal data is retained beyond these limits, so I'm not certain if Data Retention is strictly True or False based solely on this.

5. **Consent for Sharing**: The statement does mention that sharing requires consent except in specific scenarios (like legal reasons). So consent isn't always required, making Third Party Sharing/Collection partially True but with exceptions.

6. **Data Security**: It mentions using secure servers and encryption for transactions and communications. This definitely falls under Data Security, so it's True.

7. **Do Not Track**: The Privacy Statement does not mention any mechanisms or policies regarding tracking users' browsing behavior. Therefore, Do Not Track is False.

8. **Other Policy Changes**: The statement doesn't indicate that there have been recent policy changes affecting user rights significantly, so Policy Change would be False.

9. **Children's Privacy**: It states that no personal information is collected from children under 13 without prior consent, which relates to Childrenâ€™s Privacy but isn't directly about the statements given in the query.

Putting it all together:

- **First Party Collection/Use**: True
- **Data Retention**: True (Assuming retention periods are reasonable and within stated limits)
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True (Exceptions apply, but sharing does occur)
- **User Access, Edit, and Deletion**: False (Limited access without official intervention)
- **Data Security**: True
- **Do Not Track**: False

I think Data Retention might be a bit uncertain because the Privacy Statement doesn't specify exact retention periods beyond the scope of Smithsonian units. However, given that it's part of the standard privacy policy related to data handling, I'll classify it as True.

Based on the analysis of the Smithsonian Institution's Privacy Statement, here is the structured response:

- **First Party Collection/Use**: True  
  The Privacy Statement outlines how personal information is collected for various purposes by the Smithsonian, indicating that First Party Collection and Use are indeed part of their data handling practices.

- **Data Retention**: True  
  While specific retention periods aren't detailed, sharing occurs within Smithsonian units, suggesting Data Retention is a relevant concern tied to data handling practices.

- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True  
  The statement acknowledges sharing information with third parties for research and contracts, but such sharing requires consent except in legal scenarios. This confirms Third Party Sharing/Collection as True.

- **User Access, Edit, and Deletion**: False  
  Users can view their personal information but limited editing is possible without official intervention. Therefore, User Access, Edit, and Deletion are not fully supported beyond official actions.

- **Data Security**: True  
  The Privacy Statement emphasizes secure server use and encryption for transactions and communications, affirming Data Security practices.

- **Do Not Track**: False  
  There's no mention of mechanisms to prevent tracking user browsing behavior, so Do Not Track is not applicable here.

In summary:

- **First Party Collection/Use**: True
- **Data Retention**: True
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Access, Edit, and Deletion**: False
- **Data Security**: True
- **Do Not Track**: False
