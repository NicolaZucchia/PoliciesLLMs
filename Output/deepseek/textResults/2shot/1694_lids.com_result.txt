Alright, let me try to work through this problem. So, the user has provided two queries along with expected outputs, but I need to figure out how these expected outputs were derived from the given text.

First query is about a person requesting information using the "ogc" directive. The expected output marks Data as Answered and Other as True. That makes sense because the term "ogc" refers to Smithsonian Directive 807, which allows access to certain records under FOIA. So, when someone uses ogc, it's for accessing other information from the Smithsonian, hence Data is answered.

Next, in the second query, the user sent a request to Privacy@si.edu via email. The expected output here marks Policy Change as False and Data Security as True. Since the user didn't send an email but directly queried the contact address, no policy change occurred. However, their action does involve accessing Smithsonian policies (like the privacy statement) which is data security related.

I think I need to identify key points in each text that relate to the expected answers. For instance, looking for terms like ogc, Privacy@si.edu, or references to FOIA usage would help determine Data as Answered. Also, checking if the user interacted with specific policies like the Do Not Track or Privacy Statement affects the answers.

I should also consider what "Other" refers toâ€”whether it's about Smithsonian entities being involved in data sharing beyond First Party. And for each category, I need to see which statements from the text support the expected True or False outputs.

The process involves analyzing the provided texts and determining whether they relate to specific aspects like FOIA usage, policy changes, etc., then marking them accordingly.

**Answer:**

For both queries, the analysis leads to the following conclusions:

1. **First Query (ogc request):**
   - Data is Answered: True
   - Other: True

2. **Second Query (emailing Privacy@si.edu):**
   - Policy Change: False
   - Data Security: True
