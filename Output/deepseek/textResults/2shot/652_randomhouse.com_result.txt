Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze the given Privacy Statement from the Smithsonian and determine whether each of the 10 attributes (Data, Other, Policy Change, First Party Collection/Use, Data Retention, International and Specific Audiences, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Choice/Control, User Access, Edit and Deletion, Data Security, Do Not Track) are true or false based on the text provided.

First, I'll go through each attribute one by one and see if they apply to the Smithsonian's Privacy Statement. Let me start with the first one: Data collection and retention policies.

1. **Data**: The statement talks about collecting information from users, such as names, addresses, member IDs, etc. It also mentions sharing user data with non-Smithsonian entities under certain conditions. So yes, they do collect data.

2. **Other**: They have specific sections like "Children" and "Comments," which might imply they target different audiences or have policies for other demographic groups. Also, there's a mention of protecting information under legal requirements, which could mean their policies are tailored to others beyond just general users. So likely "Other" is true.

3. **Policy Change**: The statement was last revised in June 2014. It doesn't mention any recent updates or changes after that date unless specified elsewhere. But given the current context, I don't have information about subsequent policy changes, so maybe this is false.

4. **First Party Collection/Use**: They collect data from their Websites (e.g., names, addresses) and use it for operations like member services, member communications, marketing, and legal purposes. So yes, they use first-party data.

5. **Data Retention**: The statement mentions keeping records under certain conditions, such as compliance with laws or protecting against security breaches. They don't specify a maximum retention period, so this might be true.

6. **International and Specific Audiences**: It doesn't mention serving international audiences or targeting specific demographics beyond general ones. So probably false.

7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: They do share data with non-Smithsonian entities under certain conditions (e.g., legal requirements) and also use plug-ins/widgets that might collect information from third parties. So this is true.

8. **User Choice/Control**: The statement allows users to opt-out of receiving further correspondence, which suggests they have some control over their personal information. However, it doesn't specify if users can completely remove themselves from all data collection or if third-party vendors also have control. Maybe partially true, but I'll consider it false since not explicitly stated.

9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: There's no indication that users can access, edit, or delete their personal information on the Smithsonian's Websites. So this is false.

10. **Data Security**: They mention using secure methods for credit card transactions (encrypted) and requiring service providers to maintain confidentiality. So yes, they have measures in place for data security.

11. **Do Not Track**: There's no mention of users being able to disable tracking or opting out of tracking-related features. So this is false.

I think I've covered each point step by step, checking if the Privacy Statement supports each attribute.

7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True - Shares data with non-Smithsonian entities and uses plug-ins/widgets from third parties.

9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False - No indication of user access, editing, or deletion capabilities.

10. **Data Security**: True - Uses secure methods for transactions and maintains confidentiality with service providers.
