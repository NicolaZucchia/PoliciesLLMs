Alright, I need to analyze the provided privacy statement from the Smithsonian Institution and determine whether each of the specified categories is applicable. Let me go through each category one by one.

First Party Collection/Use: The statement mentions that the Smithsonian collects personal information (like names, addresses) for its operations, exhibits, member services, etc., which involves both collection and use. So this should be marked as True.

Data Retention: There's a section about how personal information is retained only for as long as necessary to fulfill Smithsonian obligations or member agreements, so this seems True.

International and Specific Audiences: The statement indicates that it complies with laws governing international data transfers, which suggests they handle audiences outside the U.S., hence True.

Third Party Sharing/Collection: Yes, the Smithsonian shares member information with non-profit organizations but requires consent. It also mentions third-party vendors for services like credit card processing, so this is definitely applicable, marked as True.

User Choice/Control: Members can opt-out of receiving communications from non-Smithsonian entities and control their personal info access through a webmaster contact, which implies they have some control, so True.

Data Security: The statement emphasizes the use of secure systems, encryption for transactions, and strict access controls, indicating security measures are in place. This should be True.

Do Not Track: There's no information that the Smithsonian does not track users' browsing behavior or IP addresses, which is typical for most websites nowadays. So this would likely be False.

User Access, Edit, Deletion: The statement doesn't mention any mechanisms by which users can access, edit, or delete their data. It mainly focuses on collection and retention rather than user control over modification of personal information. Therefore, this should be False.

Policy Change: The Privacy Statement was last revised in 2014. Unless there's a current policy change mentioned, we assume no changes have been made recently, so this would likely be False.
