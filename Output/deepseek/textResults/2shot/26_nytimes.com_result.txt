Okay, so I have to analyze this Privacy Statement from the Smithsonian and determine whether each of the 10 points (Data, Other, Policy Change, etc.) is true or false based on the content provided. Let me go through each point one by one.

First, looking at Data. The statement talks about how Smithsonian may share personal information with federal, state, local agencies for law enforcement purposes, court proceedings, and litigation. It also mentions sharing with organizations under 807 upon request. So yes, they do collect data for such purposes. Therefore, Data is True.

Next, Other. It says that they don't knowingly collect information from children under 13 without parental consent and use age verification to ensure it's only adults. Also, third parties are involved but their terms aren't specified here. However, the statement doesn't mention anything about unknown entities or other non-Smithsonian sources beyond what's already covered in Third Party Sharing/Collection. So Other seems True.

Policy Change. The Privacy Statement was last revised on June 18, 2014. That suggests that there have been updates over time, so Policy Change is True.

First Party Collection/Use. The statement mentions that they use outside vendors for processing transactions and member services but doesn't specify if they collect data themselves. However, it's implied because Smithsonian likely gathers data as part of its operations. So First Party Collection/Use is probably True.

Data Retention. It says the information must comply with laws regarding access under 807, security measures to protect against unauthorized use, etc., but doesn't specify retention periods beyond legal obligations. However, it does mention that they have systems in place to secure data, which implies they do retain data as needed for operations and legal reasons. So Data Retention is True.

International and Specific Audiences. The statement mentions sharing with certain entities like the Inspector General and Committees of Congress but doesn't address international audiences or specific demographics beyond age 13. Therefore, this point is False because it's not clear if Smithsonian handles data internationally or for specific groups beyond what's mentioned.

Third Party Sharing/Collection. The statement specifies that some sharing occurs under federal laws with entities like the Inspector General and Congress, so Third Party Sharing/Collection is True.

User Choice/Control. It mentions that users can opt out of receiving certain communications but doesn't specify if Smithsonian provides clear information about what data they have or how it's used beyond that. So User Choice/Control might be False because they don't explicitly state user control over their personal info, just opt-out options for specific communications.

User Access, Edit and Deletion. The statement says that access is limited to those with "need to know" and providers must protect confidentiality, but it doesn't mention users having access to edit or delete data themselves. Therefore, User Access, Edit and Deletion are False because Smithsonian likely controls access without granting users editable rights.

Data Security. It mentions security measures like encryption for credit card transactions and compliance with PCI standards, as well as monitoring network traffic. So Data Security is True.

Do Not Track. The statement doesn't mention any tracking mechanisms or how they handle do-not-track signals, so Do Not Track is False.

Based on the analysis of the Smithsonian's Privacy Statement, here are the evaluations for each point:

- **Data**: True
- **Other**: True
- **Policy Change**: True
- **First Party Collection/Use**: True
- **Data Retention**: True
- **International and Specific Audiences**: False
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: False
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False
- **Data Security**: True
- **Do Not Track**: False

This evaluation is based on the content provided in the Privacy Statement, focusing on whether each point is supported by specific mentions or implied through context.
