Okay, I need to analyze the provided Privacy Statement from the Smithsonian Institution and determine whether each of the specified categories is true or false. Let me start by reading through the statement carefully.

First, under "General Information," it mentions that the Smithsonian will notify visitors about changes in its policies if they are material to their use of the Websites, so I think User Choice/Control would be True because users have some control over what information is shared.

Looking at "Data Collection," it says that the Institution uses outside vendors for services like credit card transactions. This indicates Third Party Sharing/Collection is True since they're sharing data with these vendors. Also, they collect information through embedded plug-ins and widgets which are third-party websites, so that's another point towards Third Party Sharing/Collection.

Under "First-Party Data," the Institution collects information such as name, address, email, phone number, etc., directly from users. So First Party Collection/Use is definitely True.

Regarding User Access, Edit, and Deletion, the statement mentions that individuals can opt-out of receiving further correspondence but doesn't specify if they can access, edit, or delete their personal information themselves. Therefore, I think User Access, Edit, and Deletion might be False since it's unclear whether users have control over this.

Data Retention refers to how long the Smithsonian keeps user data. The statement isn't clear on this; it only mentions sharing with entities under certain legal requirements but doesn't specify retention periods. So Data Retention is likely False.

For "Data Security," the Institution uses encryption for credit card transactions and has measures against unauthorized access, so that's a strong indicator of True for Data Security.

Under "First-Party Data Use," they share information about users with third parties without consent in some cases but overall have First Party data used within their own operations. So First-Party Data Use is True.

Regarding International and Specific Audiences, the statement doesn't mention anything about international usage or targeting specific audiences beyond general access, so that's probably False.

Third Party Sharing/Collection was already established as True earlier because they use outside vendors and embedded widgets.

Under "Data Collection," since the Institution uses outside vendors, Third Party Sharing/Collection is definitely True. Also, in embedded plug-ins, users are interacting with third-party websites, which supports this point.

Do Not Track isn't explicitly mentioned here; the statement doesn't address tracking users' browsing activity or how they handle Do Not Track signals, so that's likely False.

Looking at "Policy Changes," the Institution provides a mechanism for users to provide feedback and directs them to specific offices, indicating that policy changes are regularly updated with user input. Therefore, Policy Change is True because they do have measures in place to notify users about changes.

Wait, but earlier I thought User Access, Edit, and Deletion was False. Let me check again: The statement says visitors can leave our Website through embedded plug-ins, so maybe access isn't entirely under the user's control? However, since it's a Smithsonian website, perhaps they do have some control. Maybe that's where I went wrong earlier.

Also, the statement mentions that individuals can opt-out of receiving further correspondence but doesn't specify if they can edit or delete their information themselves. So without explicit permission to access and modify data, User Access, Edit, and Deletion might still be False.

In conclusion, for each category:

Data: True

Other: True (Third Party Sharing/Collection)

Policy Change: True

First Party Collection/Use: True

Data Retention: False

International and Specific Audiences: False

Third Party Sharing/Collection: True

User Choice/Control: True

User Access, Edit, and Deletion: False

Data Security: True

Do Not Track: False

  The statement does not specify retention periods for user data.

- **International and Specific Audiences**: False  
  No mention of international usage or targeting specific audiences.

- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True  
  Data is shared with external entities through vendor services and embedded widgets.

- **User Choice/Control**: True  
  Users can leave the Website through embedded plug-ins, indicating some control over navigation.

- **User Access, Edit, and Deletion**: False  
  The statement does not provide explicit methods for users to access, edit, or delete their information.

- **Data Security**: True  
  The Institution uses encryption and security measures to protect user data.

- **Do Not Track**: False  
  There is no mention of tracking users' browsing activity or handling Do Not Track signals.
