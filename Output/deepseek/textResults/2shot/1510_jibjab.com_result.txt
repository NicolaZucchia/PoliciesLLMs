Okay, so I've got this query here where the user provided a Privacy Statement from Smithsonian's Websites. They want me to analyze it based on some predefined categories: Data collection and usage, data retention, international and specific audiences, third-party sharing, user choice/control, access/edit/delete permissions, data security, Do Not Track signals, policy changes, and whether it's a policy change.

First, I'll start by reading through the Privacy Statement carefully. It seems to be quite detailed, covering various aspects of how Smithsonian handles user information online. Let me break it down section by section.

The first part talks about collection and usage: They collect personal info like names, addresses, email, phone numbers, and social media profiles for registration and communication purposes. They also use this data for market research to understand what users want. So that's definitely a "True" for First Party Collection/Use and Data Retention.

They mention sharing with third parties through vendors for credit card processing and non-profit organizations. This falls under Third-Party Sharing/Collection, which is another "True."

Looking at access: Users can opt-out by informing the webmaster or using their contact methods provided. There are ways to remove email subscriptions and opt-in notices for further communications. So that's "User Choice/Control" as True.

They do allow editing and deletions through their contact forms, so User Access/Edit/Delete is also a "True."

Regarding data security: They use encryption for transactions, secure systems, monitor network traffic for unauthorized access, and require service providers to maintain confidentiality. That all points towards Data Security being "True."

For third-party sharing, they do share with credit card vendors, non-profits, etc., so that's another "True." Also, there are embedded plug-ins linking to other sites which aren't Smithsonian's, but since those sites have their own policies, Smithsonian isn't responsible for them.

They donâ€™t collect data under 13 without parents' consent, so no Do Not Track signals for children. Children's privacy is handled separately with SKOP if applicable.

The Privacy Statement links to a contact page and has a last revised date, indicating it might be updated. So Policy Change isn't confirmed yet but possible. Since the user provided this specific statement, perhaps we consider it as existing without policy changes unless specified otherwise.

Putting it all together, I'll mark each category with True or False based on the information provided.
