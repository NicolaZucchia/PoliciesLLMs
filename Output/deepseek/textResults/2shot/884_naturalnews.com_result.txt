Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze the given Privacy Statement from the Smithsonian website and determine the correct values for Data, Other, Policy Change, First Party Collection/Use, Data Retention, International and Specific Audiences, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Choice/Control, User Access, Edit and Deletion, Data Security, and Do Not Track. 

First, let's go through each of these categories one by one based on the content provided.

1. **Data**: The statement mentions that the Smithsonian may provide information to various entities like law enforcement agencies, courts, public officials, etc., which implies they collect data. So, Data should be True.

2. **Other**: It talks about third-party vendors and sharing member information with non-profit organizations, so Other is definitely True.

3. **Policy Change**: The Privacy Statement was last revised on June 18, 2014. Since that's in the past and there are no newer versions mentioned, Policy Change should be False.

4. **First Party Collection/Use**: There’s information about collecting member name and address information for non-profit organizations, so First Party is True.

5. **Data Retention**: The statement does mention that personal information might be retained to prevent violations of law or regulations, indicating they keep data for a certain period. So, Data Retention is True.

6. **International and Specific Audiences**: No mention of serving international audiences or specific groups beyond general audiences, so this should be False.

7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The statement clearly states sharing with non-Smithsonian entities like courts, officials, etc., so Third Party is True.

8. **User Choice/Control**: There’s a note about opting out from certain communications and how to do it by contacting specific addresses or organizations. So, User has control, making this True.

9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The statement doesn’t mention any ability for users to access, edit, or delete their information directly through the website. So, this is False.

10. **Data Security**: It mentions using encryption for transactions and securing network traffic against unauthorized access. So, Data Security is True.

11. **Do Not Track**: The statement doesn’t talk about tracking user behavior to serve ads or target users. Therefore, Do Not Track should be False.
