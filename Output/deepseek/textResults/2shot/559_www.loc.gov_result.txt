Alright, let's tackle this query. The user has provided two separate snippets of text, each with their own expected output tables. They want me to analyze these texts and determine the correct values for Data, Other, Policy Change, etc., based on what's in each snippet.

First, I'll look at the first snippet from a company's privacy policy. It talks about data collection, usage, retention, third-party sharing, user control, access, editing, deletion, security, and do not track policies. All these aspects are explicitly mentioned with true values except for Policy Change, which isn't addressed here.

Moving to the second snippet, another company's privacy policy, it covers similar topics but doesn't mention User Access, Edit, or Delete permissions. So those would be false in this case.

I need to ensure that each cell accurately reflects whether the respective aspect is present (true) or not (false). Also, I must remember that Policy Change isn't applicable here since no new policies are introduced.

| Data | Other | Policy Change | First Party Collection/Use | Data Retention | International and Specific Audiences | Third Party Sharing/Collection | User Choice/Control | User Access, Edit and Deletion | Data Security | Do Not Track |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| T    | T     | F             | T                           | T               | T                                       | T                      | T                           | F                         | T                | F             |

### Second Snippet:
| Data | Other | Policy Change | First Party Collection/Use | Data Retention | International and Specific Audiences | Third Party Sharing/Collection | User Choice/Control | User Access, Edit and Deletion | Data Security | Do Not Track |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|---------------|
| T    | T     | F             | T                           | T               | T                                       | T                      | F                           | F                         | T                | F             |
