Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the given Privacy Statement from the Smithsonian fulfills the user's request. The user wants to know if certain aspects of their privacy policy are true or false based on this document.

First, I'll look at each point they've listed and check against the Privacy Statement provided.

2. **Other:** The Smithsonian is an organization with many people involved, so it's logical that their privacy statement would reflect collective responsibility. Their statement mentions different offices handling inquiries, which supports this point as true.
3. **Policy Change:** Since the Privacy Statement was last revised on June 18, 2014, unless there have been updates beyond that date, no recent policy changes would be reflected in it. But since we're evaluating based on the provided document, I'll mark this as false for now but note that if updated after 2014, it might change.
4. **First Party Collection/Use:** The Statement mentions collecting information like name and address and using it for various purposes such as membership services and programs. This supports first-party use being true.
5. **Data Retention:** The Smithsonian does have a section about retaining records under certain conditions, so this is likely true.
6. **International and Specific Audiences:** They mention collection from non-Smithsonian entities in some contexts but primarily focus on domestic audiences with a Children's Privacy Statement for those under 13. This makes me think they don't cater to international audiences broadly, so I'll mark this as false unless specified otherwise.
7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection:** The Statement does mention sharing information with federal, state, local agencies and other organizations when necessary, which aligns with third-party use being true.
8. **User Choice/Control:** They provide methods to opt-out of non-Smithsonian communications but don't explicitly say users can edit or delete their own information on the Smithsonian Websites themselves. This makes me lean towards false for user access, but they do allow opting out, so maybe this is a mix.
9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion:** The Statement doesn’t mention allowing users to edit or delete their information directly through the Websites, which suggests this point might be false.
10. **Data Security:** They use encryption for transactions and require service providers to maintain confidentiality, indicating strong security measures. So this is true.
11. **Do Not Track:** There's no mention of implementing do-not-track mechanisms in the Privacy Statement, so this would be false.

I also noticed that while the Smithsonian emphasizes consent-based sharing, they don’t explicitly allow users to edit or delete their information directly on their Websites. Additionally, international audiences aren't a primary focus unless specified.

Based on the analysis of the provided Privacy Statement from the Smithsonian, here is the evaluation:

1. **Data:** Placeholder - N/A
2. **Other:** True (collective responsibility)
3. **Policy Change:** False (last revised in 2014; no recent changes noted)
4. **First Party Collection/Use:** True (collects information for membership and programs)
5. **Data Retention:** True (retains records under specific conditions)
6. **International and Specific Audiences:** False (focuses mainly on domestic audiences)
7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection:** True (sharing with agencies and organizations)
8. **User Choice/Control:** Mixed (allows opt-out but no direct editing/deletion)
9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion:** False (no direct access/edit/delete options)
10. **Data Security:** True (encrypted transactions and confidential service providers)
11. **Do Not Track:** False (no mention of do-not-track mechanisms)

**Summary:**

- The Smithsonian's Privacy Statement reflects collective responsibility and necessary policies, but it does not allow users to directly edit or delete their information nor implement do-not-track measures.

- Key points confirmed as true are collective handling, collection for services, data retention, third-party sharing, and security measures.
