Okay, so I need to figure out whether each of the given statements is true or false based on the provided privacy policy. Let's go through them one by one.

1. **Data:** It says we collect personal information about visitors and employees who use Smithsonian sites. So Data should be True.
2. **Other:** We don't share this information with third parties without consent, except for specific cases like federal agencies or law enforcement. But generally, sharing requires consent, so Other is False.
3. **Policy Change:** The policy was last revised in 2014. I need to check if there have been any updates since then. Since the user didn't mention newer laws, it's safe to assume Policy Change is False.
4. **First Party Collection/Use:** We do collect and use personal information about our visitors and employees for marketing and other purposes. So First Party is True.
5. **Data Retention:** The policy mentions that information will be retained as long as needed to comply with laws, enforce agreements, or protect visitors. So Data Retention is True.
6. **International and Specific Audiences:** There's no mention of targeting specific audiences internationally, so this should be False.
7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection:** Yes, we share information with third parties like credit card companies but require consent for others except when required by law. So Third Party is True.
8. **User Choice/Control:** The policy says visitors can opt out of certain communications, so they have control over their data usage. User Choice is True.
9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion:** The policy doesn't mention users being able to access, edit, or delete personal information freely; it mainly talks about collection and use. So this should be False.
10. **Data Security:** We take measures like encryption for transactions and have security protocols against unauthorized access. Data Security is True.
11. **Do Not Track:** The policy doesn't mention anything about Do Not Track mechanisms, so it's False.

Wait, let me double-check each point to make sure I didn't miss anything. Especially on International and Specific Audiencesâ€”since the policy is focused on internal use and doesn't target specific international audiences beyond U.S. laws like FOIA, I think my initial assessment was correct.
