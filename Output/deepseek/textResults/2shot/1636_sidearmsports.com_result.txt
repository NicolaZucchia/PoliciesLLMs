Okay, so I need to figure out how to analyze the provided Privacy Policy text from the Smithsonian and determine which of the given statements are true or false. Let me start by understanding what each statement refers to.

First, the policy is quite lengthy, but it seems to cover several aspects like data collection, usage, retention, third-party sharing, user control, access rights, security measures, etc. Each of these areas has specific clauses in the text that I'll need to check against.

The first part mentions that the Smithsonian takes reasonable steps to design and manage their websites' technology to ensure information systems are secure, which aligns with data security. So Data Security is likely True.

They also talk about encryption for credit card transactions, which relates to Do Not Track because it affects how users can be tracked online when making purchases. Therefore, Do Not Track might be True.

Looking into third-party sharing, the policy states that outside vendors only process information as needed for their functions and do not use it elsewhere, so Third Party Sharing/Collection is probably True.

Regarding User Choice/Control, the policy mentions opting out of non-Smithsonian communications but doesn't explicitly say users can control what data is collected or used. So this might be False.

In terms of User Access, Edit, and Deletion, the text allows users to remove themselves from mailing lists by contacting directly with specific organizations, which means they have some access rights but not full control over editing or deleting their data across all platforms. Therefore, User Access, Edit, and Deletion might be False.

First Party Collection/Use includes using information collected for intended purposes without unauthorized use elsewhere. The text seems to support this since it's used within Smithsonian operations, so that's likely True.

Data Retention is about how long personal info is kept. The policy doesn't specify a retention period beyond what's necessary, so I'm not sure if that makes it True or False. It might depend on interpretation, but without specific guidelines, maybe it's False.

International and Specific Audiences refers to targeting certain groups globally or specifically. Since the Smithsonian operates internationally, this could be True.

Lastly, Policy Change indicates whether users are informed about updates. The text doesn't mention a mechanism for users to know when policies change, so that would likely be False.

3. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True  
   - Third-party vendors handle data only for their functions, not elsewhere.

4. **User Choice/Control**: False  
   - While opting out is mentioned, control over data collection or use isn't explicitly detailed.

5. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: False  
   - Users can opt out of communications but lack full control over editing or deleting data.

6. **First Party Collection/Use**: True  
   - Information used for intended Smithsonian operations without unauthorized use elsewhere.

7. **Data Retention**: False
