Okay, so I need to figure out whether each of the 10 attributes—Data, Other, Policy Change, First Party Collection/Use, Data Retention, International and Specific Audiences, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Choice/Control, User Access, Edit and Deletion, Data Security, Do Not Track—is true or false based on this provided Privacy Statement from the Smithsonian. 

First, I'll go through each attribute one by one and check if they are mentioned in the document.

1. **Data**: The statement talks about collecting information like names, addresses, member numbers. So yes, data is collected. That's True.

2. **Other**: There's a mention of sharing member information with non-Smithsonian entities for programs or products. Also, accessing law enforcement records when necessary. So "other" applies here. True.

3. **Policy Change**: The document doesn't indicate that policies have changed recently; it ends in 2014. No info on future changes, so maybe this is False.

4. **First Party Collection/Use**: Information is used for member benefits like newsletters and exhibits. That's first-party data use. True.

5. **Data Retention**: The statement talks about retaining records under specific laws when needed. So they do retain data beyond regular operations. True.

6. **International and Specific Audiences**: No mention of targeting international audiences or specific regions, so probably False.

7. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: Yes, they share member info with other organizations for programs. True.

8. **User Choice/Control**: Members can opt-out from non-Smithsonian emails but not from Smithsonian's own communications as far as I see. So control is limited here; maybe this is False since they don't allow users to opt out of their own communications unless it's under a 'Your Choices' section which isn't clear.

9. **User Access, Edit and Deletion**: The statement doesn't give users the ability to access, edit, or delete their information directly through the website; such controls are usually handled by IT. So False.

10. **Data Security**: They mention using secure systems for transactions and have security measures against unauthorized access. True.

11. **Do Not Track**: No section mentions Do Not Track mechanisms. So False.
