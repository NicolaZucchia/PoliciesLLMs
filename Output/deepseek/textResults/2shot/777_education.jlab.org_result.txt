Alright, so I've got this task where I need to analyze a user's query about a Privacy Policy from the Smithsonian. The user provided some text, which is actually an excerpt from their Privacy Policy. They want me to determine whether certain statements in that text are true or false based on the given categories.

First, I'll read through the provided Privacy Policy carefully and note each section as it relates to the query's 10 specific points: Data Collection/Usage, Data Retention, International Audience, Third Party Sharing, User Choice, Access/Edit/Delete, Data Security, Do Not Track, Policy Changes, and Children’s Privacy.

Starting with the first point about Data Collection/Usage. The text mentions that they collect personal information to operate their websites, engage visitors, and communicate via email or postal mail. It also says this info is shared with third parties as needed for operations like payment processing or security. So, it's clear they do collect data for these purposes. That seems true.

Next, Data Retention: They keep visitor information as long as needed to fulfill stated purposes, notify about changes, and protect against misuse. The text doesn't say they don't retain data indefinitely, so I think this is true.

International Audience: The policy states that no one under 13 in the U.S. uses their services without parental consent. But it's unclear if they serve international users. Since there's nothing mentioned about handling data outside the U.S., maybe it's not explicitly stated. So perhaps false?

Third Party Sharing: The text mentions sharing with vendors for credit card processing and security, as well as protecting against misuse. It also includes a note that further sharing requires consent. That sounds like they do share data, so this is true.

User Choice/Control: They allow users to opt-out of certain communications via links or contacting customer service. This indicates users have some control over what they receive, making it true.

Access/Edit/Delete: The text says they don't currently let users change any part of their profile. So this statement claims that access is denied, which would be true since they say "we do not allow users to alter any part of their profile."

Data Security: They use encryption for transactions and monitor network traffic for security breaches. This suggests they take steps to protect data, so it's true.

Do Not Track: There’s no mention of a tracking mechanism or Do Not Track support in the text provided. So this would be false.

Policy Changes: The policy is stated to be last revised on June 18, 2014, but there's nothing about future changes beyond that date. However, since it was last updated in 2014 and no new info is given here, maybe it's considered unchanged for now, so true.

Children’s Privacy: The text mentions they don't knowingly collect data from under 13 without parental consent when the site is targeted towards children. That makes this statement true.

Wait, but looking back at "User Access/Edit/Delete," since the policy says "we do not allow users to alter any part of their profile," does that mean access is denied or it's just that they can't edit? I think the statement claims that users cannot change anything on their profile, so perhaps "access" is denied. Therefore, this should be true.

But in my initial response, I said User Access/Edit/Delete was false because you couldn’t edit any part of your profile. But wait, maybe it's more about whether users can access or make changes at all. If they can't even access their account to change info, then yes, that statement is true—access is denied.

Hmm, maybe I need to clarify the distinction between access and editing/deletion. Since you can’t edit any part of your profile, it implies that access (at least for certain parts) might be limited as well. So perhaps the correct classification is true for User Access/Edit/Delete because users cannot change their profile information at all.

Wait no, the text doesn't say "we do not allow users to access or edit any part of their profile," only that they don't allow altering it. It's a bit ambiguous, but I think the intended meaning is that you can't make changes, so access is denied as well.

After carefully reviewing the Privacy Policy excerpt and considering each category, here is the final assessment:

- **Data Collection/Usage**: True
- **Data Retention**: True
- **International Audience**: False (No explicit mention of international users)
- **Third Party Sharing**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: True
- **Access/Edit/Delete**: True (Users cannot edit their profile information)
- **Data Security**: True
- **Do Not Track**: False (No mention of tracking mechanisms)
- **Policy Changes**: True (Last revised on June 18, 2014, with no updates mentioned)
- **Children’s Privacy**: True
