Okay, so I have to figure out the expected output for this query about the Smithsonian's Privacy Statement. Let me start by reading through both the input and the expected output carefully.

First, the user provided a detailed Privacy Statement from the Smithsonian Institution. It covers various aspects like data collection, usage, retention, sharing, security, etc. Then, they asked to evaluate which attributes are present in their system based on this statement.

The expected output has specific fields: Data Collection, First Party Collection/Use, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Choice/Control, User Access/Edit/Delete, Data Retention, International and Specific Audiences, Policy Change, Data Security, Do Not Track. For each of these, the user wants to know if that attribute is present in their system based on the provided Privacy Statement.

I need to go through each field one by one and see if it's mentioned or implied in the Privacy Statement.

1. **Data Collection**: The statement talks about collecting information from visitors, such as those who opt-in for non-Smithsonian entities' mailings and those using certain sharing options. So yes, data collection is present.

2. **First Party Collection/Use**: It mentions using collected information for various purposes like providing services, marketing, handling payments securely (e.g., credit card transactions), ensuring security measures, and complying with laws. So first-party use is definitely there.

3. **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: The statement says that Smithsonian may share personal information with other entities, including government agencies, courts, Members of Congress, certain officials, committees, etc. Also, it mentions embedded plug-ins linking to non-Smithsonian sites which have their own policies. Therefore, third-party sharing is present.

4. **User Choice/Control**: It provides methods for users to opt-out or unsubscribe from mailings, such as contacting the webmaster or specific organizations. This shows that users have control over their data. So this is true.

5. **User Access/Edit/Delete**: The statement mentions that certain information can be edited by members (like modifying Smithsonian exhibits) and allows users to remove themselves from mailing lists. However, there's no mention of allowing users to access or edit all personal data; it mainly talks about editing specific content like member profiles. Also, the deletion feature is only for opt-out requests from third parties. Therefore, this field might be false.

6. **Data Retention**: The statement talks about how long information is kept based on purpose and legal obligations but doesn't specify exact retention periods beyond that. So data retention as a specific policy isn't detailed here; it's more of an implied policy. However, since the user asked for specific fields present, maybe this is considered true because they retain information until necessary.

7. **International and Specific Audiences**: The statement mentions handling international law enforcement requests but doesn't explicitly address audiences outside the U.S. Given that most Smithsonian activities are in the U.S., it's likely not focused on international audiences beyond legal requirements. So probably false.

8. **Policy Change**: The statement was last revised in 2014, so there have been policy changes before that date but no mention of ongoing updates post-2014. However, since it doesn't specify if the policies are dynamic or updated, this could be considered true if the system does allow for policy updates.

9. **Data Security**: The statement mentions using secure systems and encryption for transactions as well as implementing measures to protect against unauthorized access. So data security is present.

10. **Do Not Track**: There's no mention of a Do Not Track mechanism in the Privacy Statement. The focus is on compliance with laws rather than user tracking, so this would be false.

Putting it all together, I need to mark each attribute as True or False based on whether they are present or implied in the statement.

Here is the evaluation of the Smithsonian's Privacy Statement attributes:

- **Data Collection**: True
- **First Party Collection/Use**: True
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Choice/Control**: True
- **User Access/Edit/Delete**: False (due to lack of specific access controls)
- **Data Retention**: True (implied policy based on necessity)
- **International and Specific Audiences**: False (primarily U.S. focus with international legal compliance)
- **Policy Change**: True (policies can be revised over time)
- **Data Security**: True
- **Do Not Track**: False

Expected Output:

```
{
  "Data Collection": true,
  "First Party Collection/Use": true,
  "Third Party Sharing/Collection": true,
  "User Choice/Control": true,
  "User Access/Edit/Delete": false,
  "Data Retention": true,
  "International and Specific Audiences": false,
  "Policy Change": true,
  "Data Security": true,
  "Do Not Track": false
}
