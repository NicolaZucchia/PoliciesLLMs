Alright, so I'm looking at this user query where they provided a bunch of text related to a company's privacy policy, specifically the Smithsonian Institution. They want me to evaluate whether certain statements about data practices are true or false based on that policy.

First, I need to understand what each part of their query is asking for:

- **Data Collection**: They're asking if they collect any personal data.
- **Data Retention**: Whether they keep the collected data for a certain period.
- **International Audience**: If their policies apply globally or just locally.
- **Third Party Sharing**: If they share data with non-Smithsonian entities.
- **User Choice/Control**: Whether users can control their data, like opting out.
- **Access, Edit, Delete (AED)**: If users can access, edit, or delete their data.

Looking at the provided text, I start by scanning for keywords related to each point. The text mentions collection of personal information in places where visitors leave comments or sign up for newsletters. So that's a yes for data collection. It talks about retention periods and specific audience policies, so international seems limited but possibly true if they're consistent.

For third-party sharing, the policy mentions sharing with other non-profit organizations and law enforcement under certain conditions, which means it does occur, so thatâ€™s true. User choice is addressed by asking for consent before opting out or providing a way to unsubscribe, so that's a yes.

Access, edit, delete options are limited because they're controlled by Smithsonian entities and require permissions or consents. There's no clear indication users can freely access their data without such controls, so AED would be false.

Regarding security measures like encryption for transactions and password requirements, these are about protecting data but not directly related to the user's ability to control it.

Do Not Track isn't explicitly mentioned, which makes it likely false. Data security is covered through various measures, so that's true.

Putting it all together, each point needs a binary answer based on the policy details provided.
