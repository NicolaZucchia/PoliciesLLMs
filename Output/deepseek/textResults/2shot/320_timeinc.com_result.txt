Okay, so I need to analyze the given text about the Smithsonian's Privacy Statement and determine whether each of the specified areas applies. Let me go through each category one by one.

Starting with "Data Collection." The text mentions that they don't knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 without their parents' consent. It also talks about sharing member names and addresses with other organizations, which implies they do collect data. So Data Collection is True.

Next up is "Data Use." The statement says they use outside vendors for services like credit card transactions. They also provide member name and address information to non-profit organizations. This indicates that the organization does use personal information for these purposes. Therefore, Data Use is True.

For "Data Retention," it's mentioned that the Smithsonian requires service providers to protect data confidentiality, implying they retain data as long as necessary. So Data Retention is True.

Moving on to "International and Specific Audiences." The text doesn't mention anything about handling international data or targeting specific audiences beyond children under 13. Therefore, this category should be False.

Regarding "Third Party Sharing/Collection," the Smithsonian does share member information with other organizations, so Third Party Sharing/Collection is True.

"User Choice/Control" isn't explicitly mentioned in the text, but it's generally assumed unless stated otherwise. Since there's no info on users having control, I'll mark this as False.

"User Access, Edit and Deletion" is a point not covered in the provided text, so this should also be False.

Looking at "Data Security," the statement mentions using PCI standards for credit card transactions and requiring service providers to protect data. This indicates they take reasonable security measures, making Data Security True.

Lastly, "Do Not Track." The text doesn't mention any Do Not Track mechanisms or similar policies, so this is False.

I think that's all the categories covered based on the provided information.

Here is a summary of each category based on the analysis:

- **Data Collection:** True
- **Data Use:** True
- **Data Retention:** True
- **International and Specific Audiences:** False
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection:** True
- **User Choice/Control:** False
- **User Access, Edit and Deletion:** False
- **Data Security:** True
- **Do Not Track:** False

Each category was evaluated based on the information provided in the Smithsonian's Privacy Statement to determine its applicability.
