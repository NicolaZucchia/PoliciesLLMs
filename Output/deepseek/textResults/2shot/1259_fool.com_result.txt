Okay, so I have to analyze this query about privacy policies on two websites. The first part is the Privacy Policy of "The Following" website, which includes sections on data collection, usage, retention, sharing, security, and other related aspects like children's privacy, comments, etc. Then there's a second query about the Smithsonian's Privacy Policy.

Looking at the first Privacy Policy, I need to determine whether certain statements are true or false based on the given tags: Data Collection, First Party Collection/Use, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Choice/Control, etc.

For "The Following" website:
- Data Collection is mentioned as true.
- First Party Collection/Use is definitely true since they collect personal info to serve ads and improve targeting.
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: I don't see any mention of sharing with third parties here, so it's likely false unless implied. Since the policy doesn't talk about this, I'll mark it as false.
- User Choice/Control: The user can manage their Google Ad Settings, but nothing about opting out of ads in general. So probably false.
- User Access, Edit, and Deletion: There's no info on how users can access or delete their data, so false.
- Data Security is not addressed here, so it's likely false.
- Do Not Track isn't mentioned either.

For the Smithsonian Privacy Policy:
- Data Collection is true as they collect personal info for various purposes like responding to legal requests and providing services.
- First Party Collection/Use: They use personal info for internal functions, sharing with government agencies, etc., so true.
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: Yes, they share with non-Smithsonian entities for marketing or under certain conditions, so true.
- User Choice/Control: There's no mention of users having control over their data here, only that opting out requires contacting specific entities. So false.
- User Access, Edit, and Deletion: The policy mentions that Smithsonian officials can access info but doesn't provide a way for users to edit or delete it themselves, so false.
- Data Retention: No specifics on how long data is kept, so likely false.
- International and Specific Audiences: It's a federal government entity in the US, so probably not applicable here. False.
- Third Party Sharing/Collection is already true from earlier.
Wait, no, that was covered. Moving on.
- Data Security: They comply with PCI standards for transactions, but no info on internal security, so maybe false.
- Do Not Track: The policy doesn't mention this feature.

So compiling all of these into the expected outputs as per the tags given in the query structure.
