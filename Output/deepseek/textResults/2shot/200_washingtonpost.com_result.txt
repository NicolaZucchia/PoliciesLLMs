Alright, I'm trying to analyze this problem where I have two sections of a privacy policy that are separated by some text. My goal is to extract information from each section and format it into the expected output.

First, I'll look at the first section of the provided privacy policy. It starts with "The following...". This suggests that there might be something about data collection or usage here. Let's see what else is in this part:

1. The first sentence mentions collecting personally identifying information (PII) like names and email addresses.
2. It says they don't sell any user data, which relates to third-party sharing.
3. They use PII for various purposes: sending newsletters, managing user accounts, displaying content based on preferences, analyzing usage, and improving services.
4. The section ends with a note about complying with laws like GDPR or CCPA.

From this, I can gather that the first part is discussing collection (First Party), use (First Party), data retention (implied because they have to keep user information for compliance), third-party sharing (they do it), and security measures related to not selling data. So, the keywords here are Data Collection/Use, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Access/Edit/Delete, Data Retention, and Data Security.

Now, moving on to the second section after some text: "The following...". Again, this might be another policy part. The content is:

1. It allows users to access their accounts through various methods like email or two-factor authentication.
2. Users can change passwords via an account page.
3. They can request changes of display name with approval.
4. Users can log out by following specific steps on the sign-in page.

This section doesn't mention anything about data collection, usage, retention, sharing, or security explicitly beyond what's mentioned in the first part. So for this second section, I don't see any new information to add except maybe User Access/Edit/Delete if it wasn't already covered.

Putting this together, my output should list each keyword and whether it appears in either of the two sections. Since the first section covers Data Collection/Use, Third Party Sharing/Collection, User Access/Edit/Delete, Data Retention, and Data Security, all these are marked as True. The second section doesn't add anything new because User Access/Edit/Delete was already covered.

I need to make sure I'm only marking keywords present in either section as True and the rest as False or leave them blank if not applicable.

Based on the analysis of the provided privacy policy sections, here is the organized output:

- **Data Collection/Use**: True
- **First Party Collection/Use**: True (implied from data usage)
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection**: True
- **User Access/Edit/Delete**: True (from both sections)
- **Data Retention**: True (implied due to compliance measures)
- **International and Specific Audiences**: False
- **Do Not Track**: False

This output reflects the presence or absence of each keyword based on their occurrence in either section of the privacy policy.
