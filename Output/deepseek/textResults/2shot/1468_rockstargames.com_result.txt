Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm looking at two different sections from the user's input: one is a general privacy policy, and the other seems to be about Do Not Track capabilities, possibly from a search engine like Google.

First, for the general privacy policy section provided by the Smithsonian:

- **Data Collection:** It mentions collecting information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, etc. This indicates they are collecting personal data.
  
- **Data Use:** They use this information for various purposes like contacting or meeting donors and members, managing programs, events, etc., which means they're processing the data.

- **Retention Period:** The policy doesn't specify a retention period beyond standard practices, so I'll assume it's ongoing unless stated otherwise.

- **Sharing:** They share information with third parties like government agencies, other organizations, and law enforcement for legal reasons. Also, members can opt-out of sharing with non-members in some cases, but generally, they do share.

- **Security:** They mention using secure networks and encryption for transactions, so security measures are in place.

Now, looking at the second section about Do Not Track capabilities:

- **Do Not Track Mechanisms:** The search engine offers features to respect user choices regarding tracking and targeting. This means it actively manages how it interacts with users' data based on their actions or settings.

Putting this together, I'll evaluate each of the 14 criteria provided by the user for both sections.

Here is a summary evaluation based on the given criteria:

### General Privacy Policy ( Smithsonian )

- **Data Collection:** True  
- **First Party Collection/Use:** True  
- **Third Party Sharing/Collection:** True  
- **User Choice/Control:** Not explicitly mentioned, but generally, third parties can share data. However, specific opt-out mechanisms aren't detailed here.  
- **Do Not Track:** False (not discussed)  
- **Data Retention:** True  
- **User Access, Edit and Delete:** Not specified in the provided text.  

### Do Not Track Section

- **Do Not Track Mechanisms:** True  
- **Other Categories:** The user's criteria aren't fully addressed here.

**Final Output:**

For the Smithsonian privacy policy:

- Data Collection: True
- First Party Collection/Use: True
- Third Party Sharing/Collection: True
- User Choice/Control: False (since specific opt-out mechanisms aren't detailed)
- Do Not Track: False
- Data Retention: True
- User Access, Edit and Delete: False

For the search engine's Do Not Track capabilities:

- Do Not Track Mechanisms: True

Note: The criteria for "User Choice/Control" and other aspects related to tracking weren't fully addressed in the provided text.
